It focused on SIF Classic grantees adoption of evidence-based grantmaking strategies, ability, and willingness to build the evidence base for the service models they support, to scale the service models, and to use collaborative approaches to address local community needs. The study found promising evidence of improved organizational capacities among the SIF Classic grantees in almost all of these areas. These partner organizations changed more and faster compared to other grantmakers and programs while SIF grantees reported that the SIF program was instrumental in bringing about these changes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinal Report: Meta-Analysis of Evaluations across the Social Innovation Fund Program\r\n\r\nA meta-analysis of 38 final evaluation reports completed by evaluators for the SIF grantees and subgrantees and submitted to CNCS in order to assess the state of SIF evaluation findings as of May 2016. The findings from this report are mostly from the 2010 cohort, as these groups of grantees or subgrantees had completed their evaluations. The evaluation findings show that most of the SIF-funded interventions (87%) for which evaluation reports are available were implemented with fidelity. The same percentage of the programs were found to have had a positive impact on all or some target outcomes.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nTechnical Report: The SIFs Impact on Strengthening Organizational Capacity\r\n\r\nThe national assessment employs a quasi-experimental design (QED) to evaluate the impact of the SIF on organizational change. The findings presented in this report primarily draw on data from surveys, as well as follow-up interviews with the SIF grantees. The national assessment found promising evidence of improved organizational capacities among the SIF grantees.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nInterim Report: Meta-Synthesis of Evaluations Across the SIF\r\n\r\nA meta-synthesis of 26 final evaluation reports completed by evaluators for SIF grantees and subgrantees. These evaluations focus on 2010 grantees and findings show that most SIF-funded programs were implemented with fidelity and had a positive impact on target outcomes. The SIF pipeline of ongoing evaluations will continue to generate more results in the coming years.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nExecutive Summary: The SIF's Impact on Strengthening Organizational Capacity\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the SIF national assessment is to facilitate program evaluation and management by CNCS, support the greater goal of learning from the federal governments tiered-evidence initiatives, and conduct an independent evaluation of the SIF program.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBelow are additional resources related to the SIF Classic National Assessment:\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\tIssue Brief #1: Partnering for Success in the Social Innovation Fund  This issue brief shares lessons about how the SIF intermediary grantees collaborate with a host of partners at multiple levels to implement their programs. It provides action-oriented recommendations for current, incoming, and prospective SIF grantees, private and nonprofit organizations that might implement a SIF model, and policy makers.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tIssue Brief #2: Building SIF Subgrantee Capacity for Scale, Evidence, and Impact  This issue brief shares lessons about how the SIF builds capacity within its stakeholder organizations in order to strengthen them and enhance their impact. It provides action-oriented recommendations for current, incoming, and prospective SIF grantees, private and nonprofit organizations that might implement a SIF model, and policy makers.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tIssue Brief #3: Using Data to Improve SIF Programs: Lessons from Practitioners  This issue brief shares lessons about how SIF grantees and subgrantees use data to improve their programs. It provides action-oriented recommendations for current, incoming, and prospective SIF grantees, private and nonprofit organizations that might implement a SIF model, and policy makers.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tIssue Brief #4: Evidence of Organizational Change among SIF Grantees  This issue brief shares lessons about changes in SIF grantees organizational capacity  infrastructure, skills, attitudes, and behaviors  to carry out their work as grantmaking organizations. Organizational change occurred to conduct and use evaluations, scale promising programs, and select and support subgrantees in ways that build the evidence base for promising community interventions.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tIssue Brief #5: Designing and Implementing Rigorous Evaluation for the Social Innovation Fund  This issue brief shares best practices and lessons about how SIF grantees and subgrantees strive to conduct rigorous third-party evaluations. It provides action-oriented recommendations for current SIF grantees, nonprofit organizations, and policy makers. This brief is informed by interviews with four SIF grantees (also known as intermediaries), two subgrantees, and four evaluators, as well as insights gleaned from other SIF-related sources, including document reviews and interviews conducted for other briefs.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tIssue Brief #6: Funder Participation in the Social Innovation Fund  This issue brief explores the relationships between SIF Classic grantees and subgrantees and their match funders. It also provides action-oriented recommendations for current SIF grantees, subgrantees, and match funders; other grantmakers and grantee partners considering a SIF-type model; nonprofit organizations; and policy makers. This brief is informed by interviews with three SIF grantee organizations (also referred to as intermediaries), three subgrantees, and five match funders.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tIssue Brief #7: Scaling Programs and Growing Impact with the Social Innovation Fund  Scaling was one of the SIFs pillars and addressed its goal of finding what works, and making it work for more people,growing the impact of the work. Specifically, the Congressional authorization required grantees to use funds received through the SIF to \"make subgrants to community organizations that will use the funds to replicate or expand proven initiatives, or support new initiatives, in low-income communities. Results from the SIF National Assessments grantee survey showed that SIF grantees increased their reliance on rigorous evaluation as a basis for selecting programs to scale up. This issue brief shares best practices and lessons about ways that SIF grantees and their subgrantees used evidence of effectiveness to deepen or broaden their impact.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tIssue Brief #8: Sustaining Evidence-Based Work after the SIF  This issue brief shares best practices and lessons about ways that SIF Classic grantees and their subgrantees approached sustaining evidence-based programs. The brief focuses exclusively on SIF Classic, so all references to SIF structure and its operations concern SIF Classic. The brief first discusses how grantees and subgrantees defined what it means for work to be sustainable. It then presents an overview of approaches they used to sustain key elements of the work financially, programmatically, and organizationally. The brief also includes examples of the support that grantees provided to help subgrantees sustain their programs. It presents action-oriented recommendations for grantees, private and nonprofit organizations, and policy makers.\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "Gateway to College serves students who have dropped out of high school, or are at risk of dropping out, by providing the opportunity to earn a high school diploma and credits towards a postsecondary degree. Gateway to College conducted an implementation study to better understand the Gateway to College model, assess the extent to which it was implemented as designed, and draw lessons for Gateway to College sites. The implementation evaluation was conducted at three Gateway locations, with one site per state: California, Colorado, and Washington. The evaluation aimed to answer four questions and found:Who does the model serve? The population served at these three sites is both challenged and promising. Many of the students enrolled in the program had not been disconnected from education for long periods of time. This finding suggests that the program may have a stronger focus on dropout prevention than dropout recovery. Were the core elements of the model implemented as planned? At a high-level, the participating sites implemented the core model as designed. This is a promising finding since implementing elements of the core model is what makes this program most effective.What kinds of adaptations were made to meet the needs of the local contex and student population? The main adaptations across the three sites included how the career development course was implemented and how the learning communities were formed. What factors facilitated or impeded successful program implementation? One important factor that most students found useful was the strong relationships they developed with instructors anResource Specialists (counselors/ advisors). Students at thethree sites appreciated being treated with maturity and respect by program staff. If a student began to fall behind, program staff worked with the student to identify ways of mitigating their challenges, as opposed to punishing the student. The biggest challenge experienced by the program was retaining students in the program during the initial term. Less than half of students were able to pass all of their Gateway to College courses and successfully transition to a mainstream community college. ",

Another 13 percent engaged in Capacity Building activities; male volunteer respondents younger than 65 years of age were more likely than women to engage in national priority service activities as were those younger than 65 years of age. Approximately 42 percent of the volunteer respondents engaged in service activities that directly support their communities such as neighborhood watch. \r\n\r\n \r\n",

To address this question, researchers executed a data match of a sample of three cohorts of AmeriCorps alumni (who completed their last term of service in 2005, 2010, and 2013) to postsecondary enrollment and graduation records held by the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC).The study found high levels of enrollment and degree completion for alumni in the NSC match:AmeriCorps alumni had significantly higher levels of degree attainment than did the general adult population in the United States.Alumni with two terms of service had the highest levels of enrollment and educational attainment.Female alumni and those with higher levels of prior education had higher overall levels of enrollment. Female alumni had higher degree attainment than male alumni across the board, except for doctorates.The most common major associated with an alumnus highest degree was education, followed by social sciences, public administration and social services, business, and health professions.It should be noted that due to several factors, a 100% data match was not possible.

Researchers matched data from alumni of three cohorts with postsecondary records, discovering that those with two terms of service had the highest enrollment and attainment rates. Female alumni and those with more prior education showed greater enrollment levels. The most common major for alumni was education, followed by social sciences and business. Limitations in data matching were noted, affecting results interpretation."

Given the substantial revisions to the model, and as a precursor to a second rigorous evaluation, Child Trends and CHS (together with funding partners) proposed a formative evaluation to assess the overall referral process (of children to FF) and the degree to which the different tiers of FF were implemented with fidelity.Key findings:CHS implemented the new tiered FF program in a purposeful and supportive manner.Earlier model components (i.e., those implemented previously under the original FF model) were implemented with overall greater fidelity than the later components (i.e., the newly added FF activities, such as child and family preparation).Overall, compared with children served during the previous evaluation, children served by CHS during this study period (receiving Tiers 2 and 3) experienced better permanency and placement.In general, when FF services were implemented with greater fidelity, children experienced better outcomes. This finding, too, should be interpreted with caution as it represents an association between fidelity and outcomes, not a causal relationship.",

The clinics would be managed by Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (APRN) and virtually linked to physician specialists in Lexington and Mt. Sterling via telehealth technologies.The purpose of this evaluation was to provide program staff and funders information about the implementation of these two rural clinics and provide preliminary evidence of program impact by documenting program outputs and outcomes.The study found that:In 2012, there were 687 unduplicated patients seen in all clinic locations. Implementation of telemedicine services was delayed through the end of 2012. Only a few telemedicine consults were held to test the system and equipment. The absence of telemedicine services significantly lowered the anticipated return patient visits that would have likely been for telemedicine consultations with specialty providers.The average patient at these clinics identified as white, was between 40 and 64 years of age, had an income of less than $10,000 per year, and had a high school diploma as their highest educational attainment. Patients were mixed in terms of working full-time, part-time and not at all. Most patients had either public insurance (Medicaid, Medicare) or were paying out of pocket.All clinics combined, the average change in miles travelled for care per unique patient fell from 5.1 to 2.8 and per visit from 16.0 to 10.5.Some evidence suggests improved health care utilization and satisfaction with care.

The SIF awards grants to grant-making nonprofit organizations which, in turn, select, fund, and support local nonprofit organizations to implement community-based projects in one of three core areas: youth development, economic opportunity, and healthy futures. The federal funds are matched by grantees and subgrantees leveraging $3 of funding for each $1 of federal funds.Employing a quasi-experimental design, the national assessment found improved organizational capacity among SIF grantees. Between 2009 and 2014, funded SIF grantees reported improvement in 13 out of 14 measures of organizational capacity. Compared to applicants who were not awarded SIF funding and to a national sample of grant-making nonprofits (Cohen, 1988), SIF had a large impact on the evaluation capacity of SIF grantees, a medium impact on their support for subgrantees and scaling, and a small impact on subgrantee selection and collaboration.

    "body": "The Kids in Transition to School (KITS) program was implemented in 13 school districts in Lane County, Oregon. KITS is a brief but intensive kindergarten readiness program designed to help prepare high-risk children and their parents for entry into elementary school. It focuses on teaching children literacy, numeracy, prosocial, and self-regulation skills that are critical for school readiness and positive school adjustment. Additionally, parents participate in workshops in which they learn skills for supporting learning at home, promoting positive child behaviors, and becoming involved in their child's school.This report summarizes findings from the Year 1 Feasibility Study which used a mixed-method, quasi-experimental comparison group design, including open-ended interviews with key stakeholders (school district administrators, principals, KITS teachers, assistant teachers, parent group facilitators, community partners, and parents); focus groups with KITS parents; web-based surveys with KITS training participants; pre-and post-KITS surveys with KITS participants and a quasi-experimental comparison group; and direct child assessments done pre- and post-KITS with a small group of KITS and comparison group children. In addition, detailed records were kept regarding recruitment and data collection strategies and results.Feasibility and Process study findings identified a number of project successes and challenges during the first implementation Year. In terms of successes, the evaluation documented the following:The KITS program was well-received by both KITS teachers and part?icipating families.The KITS training and implementation support/coaching provided by Oregon Social Learning Center (OSLC) was a key driver of implementation success.KITS teachers described potentially meaningful impacts of the KITS training on their own professional development as teachers.Preliminary data suggests that most KITS groups were implemented at a fairly high level of fidelity.Challenges included:The short timeline for recruitment of families, hiring, and start-up.Inability to recruit a randomized comparison group.Challenges recruiting Hispanic/Latino and other potentially higher-risk families.Challenges implementing parent groups with Spanish-speaking families, and need to enhance the cultural appropriateness of the KITS model.Attendance, especially for parent groups and for both groups during Fall sessions.The steep learning curve regarding KITS curriculum and approaches.Technical challenges with KITS group videotaping.Logistical challenges related to facilities and transportation.",

The model delivers a continuum of core services through group workshops and individual coaching sessions, including career coaching, supportive services, computer skills training, financial capability building, and job search skills and employer engagement.This report summarizes observations from the implementation study, which included two rounds of site visits to each community college implementing Back to Work 50+: Women's Economic Stability Initiative (BTW50+: WESI). It also draws on 221 telephone surveys completed with BTW 50+: WESI participants three months after program enrollment as part of the outcomes study. The study found that:Subgrantees have fully or partially implemented most elements of the program model. Implementation of the career coaching, computer skills training, and job search skills training elements show the highest fidelity to the intended model.Even within elements of the program implemented with fidelity, subgrantees show notable variations in how they deliver these services.Subgrantee familiarity with the target population and with providing similar services is correlated with fidelity of implementation.The program's database, the Foundation Impact System (FIS), has been challenging for subgrantees to use, despite technical assistance and attempts to streamline data entry.

The study examined if WINGS had a positive impact after the first and second year of participation on childrens person-centered competencies, relationships and behaviors in the classroom and at home, short-term academic skills, and whether impacts vary depending on childrens characteristics or level of initial skills.The results of one year of participation show no significant effects, which is consistent with WINGS theory that two years of participation is needed.In building block measures, children who attended WINGS for two years showed significant gains in naming vocabulary (effect size = .26, p<0.05) and executive function (Head-Toes-Knees-Shoulders, effect size = .26, p<0.10).They also showed promising gains in positive classroom behavior and reducing negative classroom behaviors, although these do not reach the p<0.05 significance level.",

The evaluation examines the theory that when individuals with significant health costs experiencing homelessness have access to affordable housing and wraparound services, they will experience increased housing stability and improved health, and decrease the use of costly, crisis health care services. Participating sites provided affordable, stable housing and case management to improve connections to health care services, improve health outcomes, and reduce health care costs. Sites differed in terms of population size, type of jurisdiction, housing market, and policy landscape. A research team at New York University conducted an implementation evaluation that included site visits, a pre-post participant survey, a cost effectiveness study, and analyses of program impacts using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design and intent to treat (ITT) analyses and a quasi-experimental design with a treatment on the treated (TOT) approach.Overall, the evaluation found that these programs can reduce utilization of shelters and costly health care in some populations, and these reductions can substantially offset program costs. The findings from the impact and cost analysis were mixed, but reflect the impact of variations in state and local regulations, services, and homeless populations.It is possible to develop and deliver a medically-oriented supportive housing program targeted at homeless individuals who are high utilizers of health care using a data-driven approach. CSH is working to increase access to supportive housing for high need populations and embed supportive housing as a health care solution.",

The study also asked a series of questions about how the Partnership was implemented in the SIF years.Research Questions:The study featured both implementation and outcome questions. The research questions were:Implementation Questions:What are program and tutor characteristics?To what extent and how did the tutoring programs in Strategies A, B, and B3 participate in the services offered by the Tutoring Partnership (e.g. professional development, technical assistance, and tutor training)?How do programs perceive the effectiveness of services provided to them through the Tutoring Partnership? What is their level of satisfaction with the services? How do programs perceive their growth?To what extent do programs achieve Best Practices for Tutoring Programs as rated by programs on the Best Practices self-assessment?Outcome Questions:To what extent do the three capacity building strategies (Strategies A, B, and B3) affect reading growth for students?To what extent do the three capacity building strategies (Strategies A, B, and B3) affect reading proficiency for students?To what extent does tutoring have a differing effect on reading growth and proficiency for low-income students, compared to students not from low-income families?To what extent does tutoring have a differing effect on reading growth and proficiency for specific racial and ethnic groups?To what extent does participation in the Tutoring Partnership improve program quality as measured by Program Quality Assessment over time? Does this growth differ by strategy? Does this growth differ based on the number of years receiving the intervention?Findings:The study found the following:Strategy B/B3 programs had higher rates of participation in key Tutoring Partnership services such as professional development workshops, technical assistance, and tutor training.

    "body": "In 2016, United Way of Lane County expanded the Kids in Transition to School (KITS) program to 13 school districts in Lane County, Oregon. KITS is a kindergarten readiness program designed to help prepare high-risk children and their parents for entry into elementary school. It focuses on teaching children literacy, numeracy, prosocial and self-regulation skills that are critical for school readiness and positive school adjustment. Parents also participate in workshops in which they learn skills for supporting learning at home, promoting positive child behaviors, and becoming involved in their childs school.Study Goals:The goals of the Impact Study were to:Conduct a randomized outcome study of the KITS program in schools identified as potentially able to recruit more families than could be served.Conduct a process/implementation study focused on learning more about key issues identified in Year 1.Research Questions:The evaluation included both impact and implementation studies. The research questions were:Impact Questions:Do children randomly assigned to the KITS program have higher self-regulation skills and more positive social behaviors at the end of the KITS program participation compared to children assigned to the control group?Do children randomly assigned to the KITS program have higher scores at school entry on the Oregon Kindergarten Assessment (OKA) of early literacy, social skills, and self-regulation skills compared to children assigned to the control group?At the end of the KITS program, do parents randomly assigned to KITS, relative to controls, provide more developmental and academic supports for learning at home?At the end of the KITS program, do parents randomly assigned to KITS, relative to parents in the control group, report greater confidence in their discipline methods and greater use of more positive guidance and behavioral management skills?At the end of the KITS program, do parents randomly assigned to KITS, relative to parents in the control group, report higher levels of parent involvement in school?Do children randomly assigned to the KITS program have higher scores at school entry on the OKA of early numeracy compared to children assigned to the control group?What is the relationship of changes in particular aspects of parenting behavior to child outcomes?Among KITS participants, what is the relationship of program attendance to improvements in child and parent outcomes?Implementation Questions:What supported or hindered recruitment and attendance for families during Year 2? What is the average level of attendance in KITS program groups?To what extent do children and parents in the control group participate in other programs that support school readiness and kindergarten transition?What can be learned about the experiences of: (1) Hispanic/Latinx and Spanish speaking children and families and (2) children with disabilities?What can be learned about the influence of KITS training on teacher practices? Specifically, how do teachers who have participated in one vs. two years of KITS training differ, and how is the KITS training and approach being used by teachers beyond the KITS program?Findings:The evaluation found the following:KITS led to significant changes in parents self-efficacy and confidence in supporting childrens readiness and success in school. The randomized control trial produced a moderate level of evidence for these impacts.The evaluation produced moderate evidence to support KITSs ability to foster the key positive relationships between parents and kindergarten teachers and school staff.There is preliminary evidence that KITS may lead to improvements in parenting skills, specifically parents abilities to set clear boundaries and more effectively support childrens self-regulation.This study did not detect any significant effects with regard to child outcomes, although larger samples may be needed.Interviews with staff and Latinx parents suggest key areas where the program could be improved to better engage and support Latinx parents and children.Implementation support in the form of staff to help with outreach and recruitment of families and ongoing training and coaching of KITS staff is critical to success.Kindergarten teachers who were trained to deliver the KITS curriculum reported that they gained important new knowledge and skills for better supporting positive child behavior, and that they subsequently used these in their regular classroom teaching.For more information, download the full report and report brief.",

The impact evaluation seeks to show the Afford programs effectiveness at a moderate level. Research Questions:The research questions for the implementation evaluation were:Were uAspire services implemented as planned?What were the number and characteristics of treatment students participating in the Afford program? Were there differences in student characteristics across treatment and control groups? What were the differences in school characteristics?What challenged implementation of the Afford program? How were challenges overcome?The research questions for the impact evaluation were:Do students participating in the Afford program complete the FAFSA/CA Dream Act application with greater frequency, accuracy, and/or fewer missed deadlines compared to control group students?Do students participating in the Afford program cite financial aid and/or cost of attendance as factors in their college decision more than control group students?Do students participating in the Afford program report higher understanding of the financial aid process and higher beliefs that college can be affordable compared to control group students?Do students participating in the Afford program report completing more steps in the financial aid process compared to control group students?Do students participating in the Afford program leverage different types of aid compared to control group students? What types of financial aid dollars and what levels of estimated bill do Afford students leverage?Do students participating in the Afford program receive Cal Grants at higher rates compared to control group students?Findings:The evaluation found the following:The program was implemented with fidelity.Afford participants were statistically more likely to submit the FAFSA/CA Dream Act application with greater accuracy than control group participants.Afford participants were statistically more likely to report higher understanding of the financial aid process and had higher beliefs that college can be affordable compared to control group students.Findings of the QED show that uAspire had a greater impact on treatment students who received all three core curricular activities than it had on the entire treatment group who only completed some of the core activities.For more information, download the full report and report brief.",

    "body": "College Possible is a college-readiness, access, and success organization that supports and coaches low-income college students through:ACT and SAT test preparationCollege application assistanceFinancial aid consultingGuidance during the transition from high school to collegeOngoing support towards degree completionThe College Possible program model is based on a premise that low-income students face barriers to college access and success that are mostly identifiable and predictable. These barriers typically fall into three main areas: academic, financial, and social/cultural. The program proposes that it can provide students with the resources they need to successfully navigate the path to college completion through the services described above.Study Goals:The evaluation of College Possible included both implementation and impact evaluation components. The impact study was designed to evaluate whether College Possible participants have greater persistence and graduation rates than a similar cohort of non-participants. The implementation study was designed to measure the programs fidelity of implementation, identify areas where the program could be strengthened, and measure the intensity and content of the coaching that students in the 2013 cohort received during each year of the study.Research Questions:The research questions were:Impact Questions:What is the difference in rates of college persistence between program participants and nonparticipants?What is the difference in rates of college graduation between program participants and nonparticipants?What differences exist in rates of college persistence among specific ethnic groups?What differences exist in college graduation rates among specific ethnic groups?Implementation Questions:How many contacts occur between students and coaches, what is the duration of that contact, and what number and percentage of the contacts are two-way?What number and percentage of contacts are initiated by students, what is the duration of those contacts, and what number and percentage of the contacts are two-way?Which curriculum topics are addressed during the contact between coaches and students?To what extent do the interactions between coaches and students include the characteristics of quality coaching practices identified by College Possible for the college program?How well does the training and ongoing supervision of the coaches support the coaches to provide quality services?To what extent does the intensity and content of the coaching impact college persistence and graduation?To what extent does the percent and number of coach-student contacts that are initiated by the student, rather than the coach, impact college persistence and graduation?To what extent does the programs impact on persistence and graduation differ between these two groups of students:students who only had in-person communication with their coach and students who had a mix of in-person and tech-based communication with their coach,students who only had tech-based communication with their coach?Findings:The evaluation found the following:The College Possible students in the 2013 cohort had greater graduation rates than students in the comparison group. There was a positive program effect on graduation rates, implying that a student in College Possible is, on average, 1.74 times more likely to graduate after four years than a student in the comparison group.College Possible students and students in the comparison group had no difference in grades or credits earned. These null findings were consistent for the three combined College Possible cohorts, and when the 2013 cohort was analyzed separately.The implementation study found that the program model encourages coaches to adapt the program to students individual needs, therefore fidelity of program implementation was not assessed.For more information, download the full report and report brief.",

The program matches low-income youth with college-educated mentors and aims to help them develop close relationships through online communication and monthly in-person events. Mentoring takes place throughout students four years of high school.In turn, iMentor hopes to leverage these relationships to help students develop the mindsets, skills, and knowledge necessary to reach and succeed in college.Study Goals:This report examines the College Ready Programs impact at the end of students 10th grade year. It also updates an analysis of the programs implementation across eight New York City high schools. Finally, it explores whether students engagement with key components of the College Ready Program has any association with positive outcomes.Research Questions:The research questions were:How was iMentor implemented during the 10th grade?What were the effects of iMentor after two years of implementation?Were stronger outcomes associated with closer mentoring relationships or with the intensity of participation in iMentor activities?Findings:The evaluation found the following:Overall schools struggled to meet iMentors implementation goals, but participation in key activities varied substantially across schools and student cohorts.There was no overall upward trend in implementation levels over time. Rather, implementation levels rose and fell across the various program components and schools.iMentor had a small, positive, statistically significant impact on some student experiences and attitudes, but not on students' attendance or academic performance.Looking only at students who had access to iMentor, those who reported feeling very close to their mentors had some stronger outcomes compared with those who did not feel as close.For more information, download the full report and report brief.",

UWGCs subgrantee, Public Education Partners (PEP), implemented Literacy Coaching between 2015 and 2018.Study Goals:The PEP Literacy Coaching evaluation included both an implementation and impact study. The implementation study aimed to:assess the level of fidelity to the specific literacy coaching model that was proposed, andprovide implementation recommendations to strengthen model fidelity and maximize the impact of services provided to students.The impact study explored the effect of Literacy Coaching on teacher knowledge, advocacy, and use of literacy strategies and improvements in classroom culture.Research Questions:The research questions included both implementation and impact questions. The research questions were:Implementation Questions:What professional development events occurred for participating teachers?What were the objectives and activities?How did these events conceptualize the literacy frameworks?What were the experiences of participating teachers?How often, how long, and with whom did the coaching of literacy strategies occur?What events occurred during coaching cycles and sessions?What were the experiences of teachers and coaches involved in coaching sessions?What supported or impeded valuable coaching sessions?Impact Questions:After participating in literacy coaching, did ELA and math teachers:demonstrate a high awareness of literacy strategies?advocate for literacy strategies?regularly use literacy strategies in classroom practice?After participating in literacy coaching, was there an improvement in:student communicative interactions?student-teacher relationships?Findings:The evaluation found the following:There was not sufficient evidence to indicate that the Literacy Coaching model was implemented with fidelity.Analysis of PEP coaching logs, interviews, and observations suggested an inconsistency in:which teachers participated in coaching in academic years 2016-17 and 2017-18;how often a PEP coach collaborated with participating teachers;the activities occurring in coaching cycles; andthe duration of a collaboration with a teacher.Most teachers (81%) reported incorporating literacy strategies in their instruction, and 76% advocated for more teachers at their school to participate in coaching.Almost all teachers interviewed (86%) reported using at least one PEP literacy practice on a weekly basis. The literacy practices used most regularly in classrooms involved discussion, both among students and between student(s) and teacher.A majority of teachers interviewed (71%) perceived an improvement in student communicative interactions attributed to the use of literacy strategies. Teachers described using more appropriate vocabulary with students, having a stronger overall framework for communicating with students, and using a more positive tone to communicate with students.Similarly, 71% of teachers interviewed perceived an improvement in student-teacher relationships attributed to their use of literacy strategies.For more information, download the full report and report brief.",

The program incorporates a two-generational approach to affect both adults and their children who are in need of economic stability.GF2020 is based on Ascends 2Gen model, using family case management to direct at-risk families to evidence-based interventions and wraparound services. The aim is for the service delivery model to improve multiple outcomes for participating families, both as individuals and as a family unit.Study Goals:The goal of the study was to assess the extent to which GF 2020 provides services as designed and to describe its barriers to implementation.Research Questions:The evaluation included an implementation and feasibility study. The research questions were:Implementation Questions:To what extent is the GF2020 model implemented with fidelity?How does implementation of the GF2020 model vary by site?What barriers exist to implementation of the GF2020 model?Feasibility Questions:Based on fidelity to the GF2020 model, what factors prevent effective measurement of a comparison group?Can data for treatment and comparison groups be collected and captured effectively?What barriers exist to developing a comparison group?What factors prevent development and retention of a treatment group for an impact study?What initial findings from participants may inform a future impact study?Findings:The study found the following:Implementation Findings:The GF2020 model is promising to both staff and participants and managed issues associated with the implementation of a new model.Staff were able to recruit families meeting core criteria and enroll them in services with set goals based on their needs. At the same time, referrals are not consistently provided to participants, likely due to differences in needs across participants.Subgrantees were delayed in official recruitment, enrollment, and programmatic activities, initially resulting in unequal enrollment numbers across sites, which have become more consistent.Feasibility Findings:GF2020s initial findings suggest statistically and practically significant outcomes among program participants, particularly in short-term outcomes related to parenting, child development, civic engagement, and mental health.A comparison group study is feasible but should take place following the continued implementation and exploratory study to account for sufficient time for analysis.The research would increase initial analytical focus on short-term outcomes given the remaining length of the grant but continue to track relationships between the influence of programming on both short and longer-term outcomes.For more information, download the full report and report brief.",

Back on Track aims to help young adults transition to postsecondary education and put them on a path toward earning a postsecondary credential. Study Goals:The LEAP evaluation is primarily an implementation study, seeking to understand how the 10 LEAP grantees launched their programs within local collaboratives and adapted the two program models to advance opportunity for those who enrolled. To answer these questions, the implementation study used site visits, in-person interviews, phone interviews, and descriptive analyses of program data. The evaluation also included an outcomes and cost study. The outcomes study explored participant engagement and outcomes using program participant data. The cost studys objective was to understand the resources needed to replicate the LEAP programs. The cost study analyzed program financial data. Results:Key findings from the study include:LEAP grantees adapted JAG and Back on Track services to focus on addressing the circumstances in the young peoples lives that constrained their potential. This included adapting how they planned to deliver core model activities to promote engagement.Back on Track participants, most of which had a high school diploma and previous work experience, had high engagement in services and high levels of enrollment into postsecondary education.Most JAG participants who enrolled received the programs key services (mostly youth that did not have a high school diploma or previous work experience), but more than half did not fully complete the program.

Among others, the research questions include:How do subgrantees develop local partnerships that allow the project to leverage community resources to connect candidates with supportive services and job opportunities?What challenges have the participating colleges encountered as they have implemented the BTW50+: WESI model?What are the key features of the BTW50+: WESI program model as intended by AARP Foundation, and to what extent have subgrantees achieved fidelity to this model, as measured through a standardized fidelity assessment checklist?To what extent do subgrantees have the internal capacity and commitment to offer effective training services to the 50+ population after the conclusion of the program period?To what extent do subgrantees target different subsets of job candidates, such as women who have experienced economic hardship as a result of limited work experience or long spells of unemployment, women with limited English language or literacy skills, or women over 60 years of age?What changes in attitudes and behavior (related to quality of life, financial management, and computer use) do job candidates exhibit during the year after enrollment?Findings:The evaluation found the following:BTW50+: WESI was implemented as intended in terms of the number and types of job candidates enrolled, as well as the design, delivery, and receipt of program services.Subgrantees reported the following challenges:limitations in the types of jobs available in the local labor market,difficulty maintaining a stable staff given time-limited grant funding,difficulty tracking job candidate outcomes during the follow up period, andlimited financial capacity to take over funding the program when the grant ended.Employer engagement was the most challenging component of the model for subgrantees to implement.Job candidates who completed surveys and participated in focus groups gave high satisfaction ratings on core components of the BTW50+: WESI program. However, many job candidates felt that connections with employers needed to be stronger.For more information, download the full report and report brief.",

A report aimed to assess the impact of Blue Engine on Common Core algebra test scores for the 2013-2014 school year. It found that students in the Blue Engine program had significantly higher average scores and pass rates compared to those who did not participate. The results suggest that Blue Engine could effectively help close the achievement gap for underperforming students by providing personalized instruction and additional learning opportunities."

    "body": "The primary aim of the Farm to School (F2S) program is to improve student health and eating behaviors. Its strategy is to encourage schools to buy directly from local growers and incorporate locally grown foods into school meal and snack programs. There is also hope that the program may have additional benefits that can impact schools, local producers, and communities.This first-year report evaluates the programs impact on the participating students attitude towards fruits and vegetables (FV) and reception of new FV. The report also evaluates the local economic impact of F2S programs along with a qualitative assessment of the barriers and opportunities for F2S implementation.Study Goals:This study explored nine schools participating in the state-wide Wisconsin AmeriCorps F2S program. The aims of this report were to describe:Baseline weight and the rate of obesityChanges in students knowledge and attitudes pertaining to food, nutrition, agriculture, and FV consumptionFV availability at schools and students consumption during school lunch mealsResearch Questions:During the evaluation, the participating students were surveyed on their knowledge and attitude towards FV. Results from the Knowledge and Attitude (KA) survey were separated into six constructs:Knowledge  These questions focused on materials given to students cover in the AmeriCorps F2S program.Attitudes  These questions focused on whether the students like previously eaten and new FV.Perception/ Self-efficacy  These questions focused on whether the students perception of their own diets (whether the foods they eat are healthy).Exposure  These questions focused on whether the students have previously eaten presented FV.Liking  These questions focused on if the students liked the presented FV.Willingness  These questions focused on if the students would try an unfamiliar FV.Findings:The evaluation report found the following:Food and agriculture knowledge at baseline was relatively high, but students scores did improve during the 2010-2011 F2S program. The most significant changes were seen among students in schools in their second year of F2S programming.Attitudes for liking and tasting FV as well as trying introduced FV increased, especially amongst students in schools that participated in years prior.For more information, download the full report.",

These members help engage volunteers, develop resources, and support families. This support is intended to improve performance at local Habitat organizations. Study Goals:This was a follow-up evaluation from a similar study conducted in previous years. The focus of the evaluation was to determine if hosting AmeriCorps National and VISTA members helped local Habitat organizations better serve communities across the United States. Research Questions:The past evaluation showed that service members increased the ability of host sites to build more new homes. Members also helped rehab more homes and engage more volunteers. The study compared Habitat organizations that hosted AmeriCorps members against organizations that did not. This evaluation replicates the previous study by examining the following questions:Do AmeriCorps members help Habitat organizations serve more families, engage more volunteers, and offer services related to housing?Do AmeriCorps members benefit from their service by gaining useful workforce training, learning new skills, and experiencing an increase in civic engagement?Findings:The findings show that local Habitat organizations that hosted AmeriCorps members were more effective than similar Habitat organizations that didnt host members. The main findings include:Habitat AmeriCorps members increase the capacity of host sites to serve more families by building and rehabbing more homes:During the 2017-2018 fiscal year, host sites built an average of 9.3 home and non-host sites build an average of 3.25 homes.Small host sites rehabbed an average of 3.4 homes versus small non-host sites that rehabbed 1.3 homes. Large host sites rehabbed an average of 5.8 homes versus large non-host sites that rehabbed 3.9 homes.AmeriCorps members increase the ability of host sites to serve more families by engaging more volunteers:Two-thirds of host sites strongly agreed that AmeriCorps members increased the number of families served as well as the quality of service.Approximately half of the host sites reported that VISTA members are strongly effective at helping to recruit volunteers.AmeriCorps members enhance organizational function in numerous ways:Host sites reported that AmeriCorps members helped them create new programs, processes, and systems that expanded the reach and performance of the organization.AmeriCorps members benefit from their year of service by learning new skills and expanding their networks and connections:Eighty-two percent of members learned about solving community problems.Seventy-six percent of members gained useful homebuilding experience.Seventy-five percent of members learned about volunteer management.For more information, download the full report.

The evaluation also looked at the key internal and external factors that influence how each strategy is implemented in AmeriCorps-funded sites.Research Questions:The research questions were:How are core program components currently implemented across the network (e.g., tutor training, coordination with classroom teachers, program model selection, EC leadership structure, tutor stipends, student assessment)? Is there strong implementation standardization/efficacy across the network? What program components have the most variability and the most consistency in implementation across sites?How are the two EC strategies  sustained tutoring in a one-on-one or small-group setting and classroom literacy assistance  being implemented?What other internal and external variables appear to most influence program results (i.e., degrees of implementation)?What supports from AARP and the school/site itself are necessary for successful program implementation?Which sites are most ready for impact evaluation and why?Findings:The evaluation found the following:There were generally strong levels of implementation across sites.A key strength of the EC program is that it meets schools and teachers where theyre at to provide a range of tutoring strategies that address superintendent, principal, and/or teacher preferences.There is evidence that the EC model is becoming more professionalized, with a greater reliance on literacy coaches and education professionals in the administration of training.For more information, download the full report.",

Research Questions:The primary research questions were:How are AmeriCorps service experiences similar and/or different among the three types of YouthBuild AmeriCorps programs?Among the three program types, based on the telephone interviews and site visits, are there major differences in the ways in which service is integrated into the overall program?Are there significant differences in outcomes among the three types of YouthBuild AmeriCorps programs in terms of core program measures?Results:The major findings included were:YouthBuild AmeriCorps programs represent a diverse array of programs in terms of organizational context, how education programs are organized and structured, the range of service experiences, and who the programs serve.While all three program types produced a positive service experience and positive outcomes for AmeriCorps participants, there were consistent, statistically significant differences among the three program types.The telephone interviews and site visits suggest that some core elements and lessons are common across program types.For more information, download the full report.",

    "gpt_summary": "During the 2018-2019 school year, AmeriCorps members provided Lexia Reading Core5 tutoring to at-risk K-5 students in 29 Des Moines Public Schools. The aim was to evaluate the impact of the intervention on student reading proficiency and support systems. Research questions explored differences in reading growth between students receiving and not receiving AmeriCorps services, effects based on service frequency, and overall benefits provided by schools with AmeriCorps members. Findings indicated consistent reading growth across schools, but intervention frequency was crucial in reducing proficiency deficits. However, the benefits of AmeriCorps services were not significantly compelling due to limited data variations across schools. For further details, the full report is available for download."

As a result, they did not appear to view scaling as different from business as usual.\r\n\tOrganizational leadership might take into consideration the characteristics and backgrounds of their personnel when adapting to serve a new target population. Employing those with similar characteristics to those they intend to serve may help to reach that population.\r\n\tOrganizations often used multiple funding sources to support scaling. This can lead to the duplication of data collection efforts in order to satisfy the funding sources different requirements.\r\n\tThe timing of funding availability might induce a grantee to condense its preferred planning period to use a schedule that is challenging given the intervention features.\r\n\tGrantees reported three logistical challenges with training grantee staff and AmeriCorps members that arose directly or indirectly due to scaling:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tReplicating to new sites meant training sometimes needed to be decentralized and conducted in more than one location, which could lead to a lack of uniformity of the training.\r\n\t\tIndividuals often needed additional information or training specific to their site, which also needed to align with the materials to implement the intervention.\r\n\t\tSites often had to juggle trainings for new and existing personnel while actively implementing their programs and serving participants\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tWhile informal and in-person communication was possible when the grantee team implementing the intervention was small, scaling led to the need to formalize communication procedures and reliance on either multiple small-group meetings at sites or technological solutions like video chatting.\r\n\tNone of the three grantees had a formal continuous quality improvement (CQI) process.\r\n\tGenerally, personnel across the grantees felt supported by their organizational leaders. The leaders were trusted and often worked to extend trust and collaboration between staff and AmeriCorps members across the programs they operated.\r\n\tIntervention developers helped to ensure fidelity to the intervention model and were involved in innovative adaptations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information, download the case study.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nScaling Evidence-Based Models (SEBM) Project\r\n\r\n The Office of Research and Evaluation (ORE) initiated the Scaling Evidence-Based Models project to support the scaling of effective interventions.

The study explored how grantees defined and operationalized scaling, discovering that many viewed scaling as part of regular operations. Challenges included logistical issues in training, the need for structured communication, and the absence of formal continuous quality improvement processes. Grantees often used multiple funding sources, leading to data collection duplications. Key recommendations and resources for effective scaling were also highlighted."

    "body": "Opportunity youth often face a large range of complex issues, such as homelessness, chemical dependency, mental health issues, learning disabilities, and health disparities perpetrated by a range of systemic issues. To address these issues in Minnesota, Youthprise partnered with the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development (DEED) Office of Youth Development, Search Institute, and MENTOR Minnesota to develop a technical assistance and program enhancement model, Opportunity Reboot. Six partner organizations were matched to implement the Opportunity Reboot model, which was designed to support youth ages 14 to 24 who were either in foster care, the juvenile justice system, homeless, or disconnected from school and education.Study Goals:The goal of this study is to assess the fidelity of the Opportunity Reboot models implementation by subgrantees, as well as preliminary outcomes and impact on opportunity youth. An additional outcome study was aimed at showing preliminary evidence of effectiveness by collecting pre-post data from participants and assessing short-term outcomes, including building youths positive identity and social-emotional competencies as well as their ability to navigate complex systems.Research Questions:The evaluation includes both implementation and preliminary impact questions. The research questions include:Implementation:Was the Opportunity Reboot model implemented with fidelity?What does participation and engagement in the Opportunity Reboot model look like for opportunity youth?Did Opportunity Reboot program partners achieve output targets (named in the Opportunity Reboot logic model)?How satisfied were Opportunity Reboot participants with their experiences and the overall quality of their programs?Preliminary Impact:Did youth who participated in programs using the Opportunity Reboot model experience measurable and significant gains in short-term outcomes over the program year? Did all youth experience the benefits of program participation equally, or were program impacts experienced differentially by diverse demographic groups of youth?Controlling for demographic, background, and implementation factors, what are the predictive associations between the youths experiences of the Opportunity Reboot model features and their short-term outcomes?In their own words, how did participants describe experiencing the features of the Opportunity Reboot model at their program sites?In their own words, how did youth describe the impact of Opportunity Reboot on their lives?What percent of youth in the Opportunity Reboot group were able to secure employment?How is this similar or different from the comparison group? What percent of youth in the Opportunity Reboot group were able to secure living wage employment? How is this similar or different from the comparison group?Findings:The implementation evaluation found the following:All subgrantees implemented the Opportunity Reboot model with increasing fidelity over time.Youth reported experiencing the Opportunity Reboot model features and were generally satisfied with the program.The preliminary impact evaluation found the following:Youth participants experienced significant gains across a number of short-term outcomes, including positivity in the face of challenge, goal-setting skills, self-awareness, responsible decision-making, relationship skills, financial literacy, job-seeking skills, and resource identification skills.Strong relationships with program staff and new mentoring relationships with adults outside of the program were core to the improved positive values, self-perceptions, and skills youth experienced, and had a transformative impact on the lives of opportunity youth.The QED impact evaluation with propensity score matching found the following:Opportunity Reboot participants were more likely than similar peers not participating in these programs to secure full-time employment over the period of a year (showing moderate evidence), and to avoid the seasonal dip in employment often seen during Minnesotas winter months. This was particularly true for youth of color.Very few opportunity youth (whether in the Opportunity Reboot or comparison groups) secured living wage employment and  although their wages did increase over time  they still fell below the state-defined threshold to support the costs of stable housing, food, and other basic necessities in the state of Minnesota.For more information, download the full report and report brief.",

Study Goals:The goal of this study was to examine the effectiveness of members training to learn if the training successfully prepared members to implement play-based learning strategies within their Learning Club programs, thereby improving their likelihood to affect positive child outcomes. Research Questions:The research questions were:To what extent are members receiving the required training to effectively implement play-based learning theory in their programs?To what extent is the Learning Club curriculum, which includes play-based learning, being implemented at each site with the intended program beneficiaries at the intended dosage?To what extent has the Learning Club experience improved childrens mathematics skills/understanding?Findings:The findings that were found include:Surveys show that both before and after training, all but one member had a high understanding of play-based learning when asked to categorize the descriptors on the survey (e.g., is open-ended, has multiple entry points, etc.). As a result, no knowledge development was documented by this measurement.There was an increase of words associated with a conceptual and practical understanding of play and play-based learning from pre to post survey  with child-directed (play) and child-centered (play-based learning) vocabulary demonstrating the most growth.Questions that showed limited growth were members comfort in working with 2nd-4th graders, the ease of bringing play-based learning into a formal learning environment, and their confidence in facilitating play-based learning lessons.Though pre/post development was not quantified through the categorization of play-based learning descriptors, growth was clear in members written definitions of play and play-based learning. Their definitions showed a richer, more articulate understanding of the Museums play theory.Overall, members demonstrated growth in their Learning Club implementation from their first to second observation.For more information, download the full report.",

These subpopulations include:families with children,people with mental health and substance abuse issues,domestic violence survivors,adults with disabilities,veterans,immigrants,unaccompanied minors, the elderly, andchronically homeless individuals.The collaborative assists people experiencing homelessness to achieve and maintain permanent housing and employment while developing self-sufficiencies. AmeriCorps members provide case management services to clients to intervene in and make a significant, measurable impact on homelessness in Austin. Study Goals:The purpose of the evaluation was to build upon findings from previous evaluations and determine the extent to which KAH is fulfilling its proposed goals. Research Questions:The evaluation includes both process and non-experimental outcome questions. The research questions include:Process:To what extent do members perform service activities with clients using the same core components of case management across all ten service sites?To what extent do members perform the same core activities across all ten service sites?Do clients demonstrate gains in housing and employment while interacting with members?To what extent do clients achieve goals beyond obtaining housing and employment while interacting with members?Non-Experimental Outcome:To what extent do clients demonstrate greater awareness of community social services resources after interactions with members during the service term?Do clients believe their self-efficacy increases, as a result of interactions with members during the service term?Do clients perceive that their confidence in advocating for themselves increases as a result of interactions with members during the service term?Do clients perceive their interactions with KAH Case Management Aides to be positive and productive?Findings:The evaluation found the following:Across both terms of service, members engaged in activities within the scope of their position description and are providing supportive case management aide services for people with significant barriers that may contribute to homelessness.Limitations arose in some aspects of the evaluation due to limited KAH staff capacity, and due to members not completing certain tasks, e.g. missing a round of the quarterly survey.Nearly 100% of members and their supervisors reported that members are performing service activities using the same core components of case managementNearly 100% of members and their supervisors reported that members are performing the same core activities across all ten service sites.For both terms of service, performance measures were met or almost met. KAH staff attributes goals that were not met to low recruitment numbers.Answers provided in the quarterly survey showed a range of services provided beyond housing and employment. For example, members noted helping clients receive benefits, e.g. disability and SNAP, helping parents with CPS cases, and helping chronically ill clients manage their health.For more information, download the full report.",

Research Questions:The research questions were:What outcomes do Reading Partners AmeriCorps alumni attribute to their Reading Partners experience? Do these alumni perceive that serving as a Reading Partners AmeriCorps member helped them develop professional and interpersonal skills or influenced or change their career and/or academic pathways?In what ways, if any, do perceived member outcomes vary by member characteristics, including age, race/ethnicity, educational background, years of service with Reading Partners, role with Reading Partners, geographic region where they served, prior service with another AmeriCorps program, cohort year, or early vs. late cohorts?Controlling for other factors, do Reading Partners AmeriCorps alumni demonstrate stronger professional and interpersonal skills and/or greater levels of civic engagement than similarly situated members of the national population? Findings:The evaluation found the following:Almost all (87 percent) Reading Partners AmeriCorps alumni were satisfied with their Reading Partners service experience and were more likely to report their service as a satisfying or very satisfying than were AmeriCorps alumni who participated in the 2015 CNCS study.A majority (>60 percent) of alumni agreed that their Reading Partners AmeriCorps service experience caused them to re-examine their beliefs about themselves or about other people (65 percent); about two-thirds reported that they did things during their service year(s) that they never thought they could do.At least 90 percent of alumni agreed that their Reading Partners AmeriCorps service experience helped them feel as though they made a contribution to the community where they served, and that they made a difference in the life of at least one person (95 percent); Reading Partners alumni were more likely to agree with these statements than were AmeriCorps alumni who participated in the 2015 CNCS study.At least 80 percent of alumni agreed that their service experience helped them gain an understanding of the community where they served and exposed them to new ideas and ways of seeing the world.Most (>50 percent) Reading Partners AmeriCorps alumni said that their service experience helped them figure out their next steps in terms of their career and professional goals; slightly more than half said the same about their educational goals.For more information, download the full report.",

    "body": "AmeriCorps National Civilian Community Corps (NCCC) is one of AmeriCorps core programs, which engages people between the ages 18-24 in a ten-month, full-time term of team-based, residential national service. AmeriCorps, formerly known as Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), contracted JBS International to support NCCCs efforts in assessing its impact on member development and strengthening communities. JBS first constructed a prototype AmeriCorps NCCC Service Projects Database (SPD) containing sample project information and was subsequently awarded a second contract to populate the database with qualitative and quantitative project information on the NCCC service projects from FY 2012 to Spring 2019 across all campuses and analyze that data.\r\n\r\nThe database contains information on 5,004 NCCC service projects completed between 2012 and Spring of 2019 from the four regional campuses plus 120 service projects randomly selected from the Atlantic campus. It includes information on things like project issue area, characteristics, sponsor organization information, and goals and accomplishments. The two primary purposes of the database are to:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tCapture key data about NCCC service projects in one location where data can be analyzed both across and within projects\r\n\tSupport the selection of case studies for a NCCC study\r\n\r\n\r\nStudy Goals\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the report is to describe the types and characteristics of service projects and understand how NCCC service projects strengthen communities and affect members.\r\n\r\n\r\nResearch Questions\r\n\r\nThere are two sets of research questions based on the study goals:\r\n\r\nCharacteristics of service projects:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tWhat are the characteristics of NCCC service projects by issue/focus areas?  \r\n\tWhat are NCCCs service project accomplishments to communities by issue/focus areas?\r\n\tHow has the type of sponsor changed over time?\r\n\tHow have the characteristics of NCCC service projects changed over time?\r\n\tWhat are the characteristics of recurring service projects? What community needs have service projects addressed over time by issue/focus areas?\r\n\tHow frequently does NCCC serve the same community with the same needs?\r\n\tHow many individual service projects are nested within unique sponsors? What is the number of sites and the average number of sites for each sponsor type?\r\n\r\n\r\nUnderstanding service project impact:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tWhat does the data show on how NCCC projects impact and strengthen communities?\r\n\t\r\n\t\tWhat does the data show on how NCCC projects impact members?\r\n\t\tDo these impacts vary and, if so, how?\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tWhat are the main themes associated with strengthening communities and Member impact?\r\n\tWhat are NCCCs service project contributions:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tto communities disaster preparation and mitigation?\r\n\t\tto support recovery and response in communities that experienced disaster?\r\n\t\tin building community and organization capacity?\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nFindings\r\n\r\nCharacteristics of NCCC Service Projects and Communities Served\r\n\r\nAnalysis of the database reveals the following top-level results regarding the characteristics of NCCC service projects and the communities they serve:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe top three issue areas are:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tNatural and Other Disasters, which made up 50% of AmeriCorps NCCC service projects\r\n\t\tUrban and Rural Development service projects, with 26% of projects\r\n\t\tEnvironmental Stewardship and Conservation service projects, which accounted for 18%.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tService projects typically had multiple project characteristics, which describe the general purpose of the project and are related to accomplishments Service project characteristics most often reported were community support (41%), at-risk ecosystems (34%), infrastructure improvement (34%), and capacity building and leverage (34%).\r\n\tCommunity support and at-risk ecosystems were recurring characteristics across the five primary issue areas. Infrastructure improvement is also a recurring characteristic across all the primary issue areas, but only 5% of service projects reported Infrastructure Improvement as their primary issue area. Lastly, Capacity building and leverage characteristics were noted in four of the five primary issue areas, but this characteristic is most frequently reported under service projects in the natural and other disasters primary issue area.\r\n\tThe greatest number of accomplishments or outputs were reported in the Natural and Other Disasters primary issue area with 9,250 outputs, and these accomplishments were reported under the disaster recovery, disaster prevention preparedness and mitigation, and disaster response categories. Service projects in the Environmental Stewardship, and Urban and Rural Development primary issue areas had the second greatest number of reported accomplishments or outputs, with more than 6,000. In these two primary issue areas, the categories with high numbers of reported accomplishments include natural resources and community well-being.\r\n\tBetween 2012 and 2019, 1,439 unique sponsors were associated with the 5,004 service projects. The Federal Government, national non-profits, and other non-profits sponsored most service projects between 2012 and 2018. The Federal Government most frequently sponsored service projects in the Natural and Other Disaster issue area.\r\n\r\n\r\nStrengthening Communities and Impact on Members\r\n\r\nAnalysis of the database reveals the following top-level results of how service projects strengthen communities and the impacts on Corps Members:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tService projects supported communities by providing direct impacts including tangible and intangible benefits to both individuals and organizations, enhancing disaster prevention, preparedness, and mitigation, and assisting communities with disaster recovery.\r\n\t\r\n\t\tThe most common organization-level impacts noted were in infrastructure support, which included enhancing an organizations data infrastructure or physical infrastructure. Infrastructure support also included Members organizing and conducting inventory of an organizations supplies or donations.\r\n\t\tThe most common community-level impacts of NCCC service projects were on the built and natural capital of communities through work on improving accessibility to public structures; building trails, gardens and farms; and supporting youth camps.\r\n\t\tThe most common individual-level impacts are on helping people meet basic needs such as accessing food and shelter, receiving disaster assistance, and developing human capital and learning through teaching volunteers or tutoring youth.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tAbout half of all service projects during the eight-year period involved disaster services.\r\n\t\r\n\t\tProjects that focused on disaster prevention, preparedness, and mitigation most commonly reported enhancing disaster knowledge and preparedness by assembling and distributing informational materials and by providing information to individuals.\r\n\t\tDisaster response projects most commonly reported impacts associated with organizational effectiveness, such as supporting disaster service facilities or volunteer facilities in disaster areas.\r\n\t\tDisaster recovery projects most commonly reported impacts associated with organizational infrastructure, for example developing resource guides or reports or completing damage or needs assessments\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tSpecific populations assisted by projects include military veterans, individuals in crisis (such as disaster survivors or the homeless), immigrants and refugees, disabled persons, the elderly, at-risk youth, and Members of Native American communities. Many projects supported more than one vulnerable population.\r\n\tImpacts of projects on Corps Members included enhancing personal and life skills, building professional skills, growing interpersonal skills, and fostering an understanding of civic engagement. The most commonly reported impacts on Members were enhancing construction and environmental management skills, increasing communication skills, building leadership skills, and fostering personal growth in areas like adaptability and confidence.\r\n\r\n\r\nFull Report\r\n\r\nFact Sheet\r\n\r\n",

In its inaugural year, the PFS program awarded eight organizations grants to either assess the feasibility of launching PFS projects, or support the transaction structuring of PFS projects, in three issue areas: economic opportunity, healthy futures, and youth development.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe Social Innovation Fund commissioned Abt Associates to develop the following reports and special topic briefs to provide practical insights on specific aspects of PFS programming and assist stakeholders in making informed decisions as they explore and implement projects.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nNote: An earlier edition of this report described PFS as an innovative method of financing social services that shares risks and rewards through collaboration of public, private, and nonprofit sectors.  The description of PFS has been revised to account for the nuance between PFS contracting, an innovative approach to tackling social problems by tying funding for a social intervention to the verified achievement of positive social outcomes, and PFS Financing (such as social impact bonds), which provides the capital to cover operating costs of delivering a social intervention.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPFS Opportunities and Trends\r\nThis report offers insight into the rapidly growing field of Pay for Success, elements of Pay for Success projects to date, opportunities for local and state governments and nonprofit service providers to learn from existing projects, and recommendations for the social sector to consider.\r\n\r\nEmerging Literature\r\n\r\nThis report provides an update on lessons learned from the Pay for Success field since April 2015.

Among children in this dosage group (n=116), 27 percent (31 children) moved to the overweight category and 7 percent (9 children) moved to the healthy weight category.\r\n\t\tAfter 2 years of treatment, the average BMI percentile decreased among the 20 children who were obese at baseline (from 20.3 at baseline to 19.6). However, the decline was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Additionally, 15 percent (3 children) moved to the overweight category and 25 percent (5 children) moved to the healthy weight category.\r\n\t\tAmong the 104 children in the obese category in the comparison group, the average BMI percentile decreased significantly at follow up (from 20.1 at baseline to 19.4) (p < 0.01).

That is, among the 134 children in the overweight category at baseline, 40 percent (54 children) moved to the healthy weight category.\r\n\t\tAfter 2 years of treatment, the average BMI percentile among children in this dosage group (28 children) decreased significantly from 18.1 to 17.5 (p=0.04). Three percent (9 children) moved to the healthy weight category.\r\n\t\tAmong the 129 children in the comparison group, the average BMI percentile decreased significantly from 17.7 at baseline to 17.2 at follow-up (p < 0.01). Data showed that 49 percent (64 children) moved to the healthy weight category at follow up.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tUnderweight category at baseline:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tAfter 1 year of treatment, there were significant increases in the average BMI percentile for 38 children in this category from 13.5 at baseline to 13.9 (p < 0.01). Among the 38 children in the underweight category at baseline, 39 percent (17 children) moved to the healthy weight category at follow up.\r\n\t\tAmong the 7 children that received 2 years of treatment, the average BMI decreased from 14.0 at baseline to 14.1 after 2 years of treatment. However, the change was not statistically significant (p > 0.05). Additionally, three children moved to the healthy weight category.\r\n\t\tAmong the 37 children in the comparison group, the average BMI percentile increased statistically significantly from 13.5 at baseline to 14.3 at follow-up (p < 0.01).

The Connections to Care (C2C) Collaborative with the Mayors Fund for the Advancement of  NYC borrowed a concept of delivering care under constrained resources from global health initiatives called task-shifting and applied it to low-income communities in NYC. Using the task-shifting concept, C2C built an innovative model that delivers mental health screening and evidence-based treatments by pairing mental health providers (MHPs) with lay (non-specialist) staff at community-based organizations (CBOs) that already serve low-income and at-risk populations. Study Goals:This report describes the C2C model and RAND Corporations evaluation, detailing:How it was implementedWhether it had the intended effect on mental health treatment, symptoms, and related outcomesHow much it costs CBOs Research Questions:There were two primary research questions, as well as additional questions broken down into three categories:How were CBOs and MHPs provided training, coaching, and supervision to support staff in implementing C2C?How were C2C services provided to clients?Implementation:How were the C2C program strategies implemented?To what extent have the CBOs identified clients with mental health or substance use issues as a result of C2C implementation?Does the CBO staff have improved knowledge of mental health and C2C modalities, attitudes, and behaviors about mental health issues and services?What are the key facilitators of and barriers to effective implementation of C2C program strategies within and across CBO and MHP partnerships?Impact:Relative to comparison group participants, do C2C participants:have greater reductions in barriers to mental health care and greater increases in utilization of mental health services?show greater positive improvement in depression, generalized anxiety, PTSD, alcohol use, substance use, and general psychological distress?show improved outcomes in the domains of employment, housing, education, and incarceration?Cost: What are the costs to CBOs associated with implementation of the C2C program, overall and average per program client? Findings:The evaluation found the following:Reaching full implementation of a complex task-shifting model requires significant investment of time and resourcesbut is feasible.Although C2C was well received by staff and providers, barriers such as stigma and access challenges were hard to overcome.C2C positively affected some populations and settings but not others.For more information, download the full report and brief.

    "body": "Introduction\r\n\r\nThe Social Innovation Fund (SIF), is a federal tiered evidence initiative that received funding from 2010 to 2016. The key objectives of the initiative were to invest in:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tPromising interventions that address social and community challenges and grow their impact.  \r\n\tEvaluation and capacity building in order to support the development and use of rigorous evidence to measure the effectiveness of each funded intervention (i.e., to move the evidence needle) and inform decision making.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll federal initiatives have some form of embedded evaluation technical assistance (ETA) component in order to make them operational. AmeriCorps developed a comprehensive ETA program organized around a flexible coaching model that included individual consultation and customized resource development. The ETA program activities were tied to the evaluation planning, implementation, monitoring, and reporting expectations and requirements of the SIF. Empirical evidence of the SIF ETAs effectiveness is found in three sources as follows: \r\n\r\n\r\n\tFindings from the SIF National Assessment which provides rigorous evidence that the program was successful in building the evaluation capacity and practices of participating organizations, \r\n\tCaliber of the evaluation designs implemented by SIF grantees, and \r\n\tCredibility of the positive and causal findings obtained through successful implementation of these evaluation designs.\r\n\r\n\r\nPurpose\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this article is to discuss the structure and key features of the SIF as a grant making model, its evaluation requirements, its embedded approach and process for evaluation capacity building (ECB), and the delivery of the ETA. It also discusses the tools and resources that ETA generated to support its goals, the evidence supporting its success, and how those lessons can inform other organizations and initiatives.\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\n\r\nThis discussion is organized in two sections: \r\n\r\n\r\n\tEarly Challenges and Opportunities\r\n\t\r\n\t\tAmeriCorps operationalization of the ETA program and its requirements experienced a number of early challenges. These challenges required adjustments and in many ways informed the development of the ETA program.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tLessons Learned From the SIF ETA Program\r\n\t\r\n\t\tLeadership prioritization.\r\n\t\tTrusting relationships.\r\n\t\tTiming matters.\r\n\t\tCustomized coaching models.\r\n\t\tDedicated resources.\r\n\t\tProgress measurement and a strong feedback loop are important for continuous program improvement and achieving the intended goals of ETA.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information, download the full report.\r\n",

    "body": "Introduction\r\n\r\nUnited Way of Central Indiana (UWCI) established the Great Families 2020 (GF2020) model in 2016. The goal of GF2020 is to improve financial stability among families and educational outcomes of children in Indianapolis by using a two-generational (2Gen) approach to service delivery.\r\n\r\nThe family coaching process involves developing a relationship with a family coach and creating a Family Success Plan (FSP) that helps the family set and maintain goals in the five areas of the 2Gen modelhigh quality early childhood education, economic assets, postsecondary and employment pathways, social capital, and health and well-being. Additionally, GF2020 connects families to services in those five areas that are provided by participating subgrantee agencies. \r\n\r\nStudy Goals\r\n\r\nThe goals of this evaluation are to:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tExamine the implementation of the GF2020 service delivery process and model (implementation study)\r\n\tAssess the extent to which the GF2020 model is associated with improvements in outcomes of the GF2020 model to achieve short-term outcomes during the first six months to two years of enrolling families (outcomes study)\r\n\r\n\r\nResearch Questions\r\n\r\nThe evaluation includes both implementation and impact research questions. The research questions include:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tImplementation questions:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tTo what extent is GF2020 being implemented with fidelity?\r\n\t\tAccording to GF2020 staff perceptions, has collaboration between sites and partner/contracted service providers and agencies improved?\r\n\t\tWhat factors affect GF2020 participant recruitment, enrollment, and retention? \r\n\t\tIn what ways has programming differed by site? \r\n\t\tHow have initial implementation plans changed after program initiation? \r\n\t\tTo what extent do participants perceive opportunities and short-term and long-term benefits of the following programmatic component \r\n\t\tWhat participant characteristics are associated with perceptions of GF2020 programming? \r\n\t\tTo what extent do subgrantee staff perceive short-term and long-term benefits of the programmatic components? \r\n\t\tFor programmatic components that are perceived to be most beneficial for participants, what is necessary for proper implementation? \r\n\t\tWhat is the level of parent/caregiver and child participation at each program site? \r\n\t\tWhat barriers exist for consistent data collection and entry? \r\n\t\tWhat lessons/takeaways have grantees and subgrantees learned about 2Gen programming generally? \r\n\t\tWhat perspectives can GF2020 provide for UWCIS ongoing local programming? \r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tOutcomes questions:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tWhat proportion of GF2020 children are performing at age-appropriate functioning? \r\n\t\tTo what extent do GF2020 participants differ from Centers For Working Families (CWF) participants on short-term outcomes? \r\n\t\tTo what extent do GF2020 participant outcomes change from baseline to follow-up? \r\n\t\tWhich GF2020 program components are associated with parent outcomes? \r\n\t\tTo what extent do participant outcomes vary by site? \r\n\t\tWhich GF2020 parent characteristics or program components are associated with child outcomes? \r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nFindings\r\n\r\nThe implementation study found the following: \r\n\r\n\r\n\tGF2020 is largely being implemented with fidelity across three core components of early childhood education, economic assets, and employment coaching, with subgrantees varying slightly in how they implement the model. \r\n\tMore than half (60%) of the participating adults are bundling CWF services, and financial counseling continues to be the most popular CWF service. \r\n\tSubgrantees have improved data collection and entry, primarily due to continued technical support from UWCI, though capturing and documenting data for referrals and social capital events can be improved. \r\n\tCoaching is largely perceived as an integral component of GF2020. Frequent engagement with participants and flexibility of engagement approaches help to retain families and ensure services are appropriate. \r\n\tMore families set and work toward their goals, though the type and number of goals differ by subgrantee. These variations can be attributed to differences in participants abilities to reach goals and the nature of short-term versus long-term goals.\r\n\tThe outcomes study found the following:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tProgrammatic components, including length of coaching interactions and referrals were associated with improvements in some parent outcomes. Adults with longer coaching interactions, referrals from a GF2020 coach, and who attended a referral appointment were linked to better parent outcomes.\r\n\t\tDespite slight variations in GF2020 implementation, site-level differences did not affect participant outcomes. However, key programmatic aspectssuch as the proportion of referrals to health activities, length of coaching interactions, and perceived quality of collaborationmatter for participant outcomes. Participants at sites with higher levels of perceived collaboration experienced improvements in nurturing, attachment, and social support. When accounting for site-level differences, the average length of coaching was also positively and significantly associated with nurturing, attachment, and change in income\r\n\t\tSociodemographic characteristicslike race, ethnicity, baseline income, and agedid not affect improvements in income. This indicates that GF2020 did not contribute to disparate outcomes related to income. At the same time, being Hispanic/Latinx was associated with greater concrete supports.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information, download the report materials.\r\n\r\n full report\r\n\r\nReport brief\r\n \r\n",

FOTC targets children facing barriers like systemic poverty, structural racism, childhood trauma, foster care, underfunded schools, and homelessness and matches them with Friends (paid professional mentors). The Friends provide developmentally appropriate experiential teaching and modeling of healthy behaviors, directly coaching children on social-emotional skill development areas, referred to as core assets in the FOTC program model. At the close of this study, there were 493 youth still enrolled in FOTC at the seven participating sites across the country.\r\n\r\nStudy Goals\r\n\r\nThis evaluations three goals were to:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tBe an addition to the programs existing body of evidence. It examined facilitators and challenges to implement the FOTC program in new sites and a new populationyouth enrolled through the child welfare system or through referring partner agencies. \r\n\tInform the development of the new quality improvement (QI) system for training, supporting and supervising program staff.

The research questions include:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tOutcomes study:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tDoes participation in FOTC result in a decreased length of stay in foster care? \r\n\t\tDoes participation in FOTC result in a reduced number of placements? \r\n\t\tDoes participation in FOTC result in a faster time to permanency? \r\n\t\tDoes FOTC participation increase the likelihood of achieving permanency? \r\n\t\tDoes participation in FOTC reduce number of re-entries to care?\r\n\t\tDoes participation in FOTC reduce number of removals?\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tImplementation study:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tTo what extent did Friends implement the FOTC program model with program participants? \r\n\t\tWhich features of the FOTC settings appear to be associated with the successful implementation of the program model with children? \r\n\t\tWas the Friends professional development capacity building (e.g., Friend training and supervision) implemented with fidelity? \r\n\t\tDoes participation in FOTC improve parents perceptions of gains in childrens socio-emotional learning and their own parenting efficacy?\r\n\t\tWhat strategies are effective in surveying caregivers of children participating in the program?\r\n\t\tDoes participation in FOTC improve parents perceptions of family stability?\r\n\t\tDoes participation in FOTC improve positive relationship building and self-management?\r\n\t\tDoes participation in FOTC improve childrens school behavior as measured by disciplinary incidents? \r\n\t\tDoes participation in FOTC improve grade-level academic performance as measured by reading and math proficiency on standardized tests? \r\n\t\tDoes participation in FOTC improve school attendance as measured by absenteeism? \r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nFindings\r\n\r\nThe evaluation found the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe implementation evaluation found that program sites generally implemented the model with fidelity, with all sites, on average, achieving the targeted number of school and caregiver contacts each month. Sites struggled the most with achieving the targeted number of hours with youth due to COVID-related safety precautions.\r\n\tFindings from the caregiver survey indicate that FOTC helped caregivers strengthen family relationships and parenting and connected them to concrete supports that promoted family well-being.\r\n\tThe child welfare exploratory outcomes study found that program youth (FOTC-enrolled) had a significantly decreased length of stay in foster care (an average of 399 days) compared to the comparison group (an average of 576 days). \r\n\tThe school study was exploratory and limited due to challenges identifying an appropriate comparison group with administrative data.  Findings confirmed those in FOTCs randomized control trial (RCT) study namely that the programs impacts during the early years are not demonstrable using school administrative data. Caregivers reports of significant youth progress on key social-emotional skills are aligned with early learning research and are more illustrative of the programs impact at school in the elementary years.  \r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information, download the full report, brief, and caregiver report.\r\n\r\nFull report\r\n\r\nReport brief\r\n\r\nCaregiver report\r\n \r\n",

    "url": "/evidence-report/sif-classic-national-assessment-issue-briefs",
    "body": "The Issue Briefs are part of the National Assessment of the SIF Classic Program commissioned by AmeriCorps (formerly the Corporation for National and Community Service) and conducted by ICF International.  The assessment focused on SIF Classic grantees adoption of evidence-based grantmaking strategies, ability, and willingness to build the evidence base for the service models they support, to scale the service models, and to use collaborative approaches to address local community needs. The study found promising evidence of improved organizational capacities among the SIF Classic grantees in almost all of these areas. These partner organizations changed more and faster compared to other grantmakers and programs while SIF grantees reported that the SIF program was instrumental in bringing about these changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIssue Brief #1: Partnering for Success in the Social Innovation Fund  This issue brief shares lessons about how the SIF intermediary grantees collaborate with a host of partners at multiple levels to implement their programs. It provides action-oriented recommendations for current, incoming, and prospective SIF grantees, private and nonprofit organizations that might implement a SIF model, and policy makers.\r\n\tIssue Brief #2: Building SIF Subgrantee Capacity for Scale, Evidence, and Impact  This issue brief shares lessons about how the SIF builds capacity within its stakeholder organizations in order to strengthen them and enhance their impact. It provides action-oriented recommendations for current, incoming, and prospective SIF grantees, private and nonprofit organizations that might implement a SIF model, and policy makers.\r\n\tIssue Brief #3: Using Data to Improve SIF Programs: Lessons from Practitioners  This issue brief shares lessons about how SIF grantees and subgrantees use data to improve their programs. It provides action-oriented recommendations for current, incoming, and prospective SIF grantees, private and nonprofit organizations that might implement a SIF model, and policy makers.\r\n\tIssue Brief #4: Evidence of Organizational Change among SIF Grantees  This issue brief shares lessons about changes in SIF grantees organizational capacity  infrastructure, skills, attitudes, and behaviors  to carry out their work as grantmaking organizations. Organizational change occurred to conduct and use evaluations, scale promising programs, and select and support subgrantees in ways that build the evidence base for promising community interventions.\r\n\tIssue Brief #5: Designing and Implementing Rigorous Evaluation for the Social Innovation Fund  This issue brief shares best practices and lessons about how SIF grantees and subgrantees strive to conduct rigorous third-party evaluations. It provides action-oriented recommendations for current SIF grantees, nonprofit organizations, and policy makers. This brief is informed by interviews with four SIF grantees (also known as intermediaries), two subgrantees, and four evaluators, as well as insights gleaned from other SIF-related sources, including document reviews and interviews conducted for other briefs.\r\n\tIssue Brief #6: Funder Participation in the Social Innovation Fund  This issue brief explores the relationships between SIF Classic grantees and subgrantees and their match funders. It also provides action-oriented recommendations for current SIF grantees, subgrantees, and match funders; other grantmakers and grantee partners considering a SIF-type model; nonprofit organizations; and policy makers. This brief is informed by interviews with three SIF grantee organizations (also referred to as intermediaries), three subgrantees, and five match funders.\r\n\tIssue Brief #7: Scaling Programs and Growing Impact with the Social Innovation Fund  Scaling was one of the SIFs pillars and addressed its goal of finding what works, and making it work for more people,growing the impact of the work. Specifically, the Congressional authorization required grantees to use funds received through the SIF to \"make subgrants to community organizations that will use the funds to replicate or expand proven initiatives, or support new initiatives, in low-income communities. Results from the SIF National Assessments grantee survey showed that SIF grantees increased their reliance on rigorous evaluation as a basis for selecting programs to scale up. This issue brief shares best practices and lessons about ways that SIF grantees and their subgrantees used evidence of effectiveness to deepen or broaden their impact.\r\n\tIssue Brief #8: Sustaining Evidence-Based Work after the SIF  This issue brief shares best practices and lessons about ways that SIF Classic grantees and their subgrantees approached sustaining evidence-based programs. The brief focuses exclusively on SIF Classic, so all references to SIF structure and its operations concern SIF Classic. The brief first discusses how grantees and subgrantees defined what it means for work to be sustainable. It then presents an overview of approaches they used to sustain key elements of the work financially, programmatically, and organizationally. The brief also includes examples of the support that grantees provided to help subgrantees sustain their programs. It presents action-oriented recommendations for grantees, private and nonprofit organizations, and policy makers.\r\n\r\n",

Because scaling documents were developed before AmeriCorps adopted the SPREE process, information provided was not always specific enough to assess readiness, the criteria for which are now clarified through the SPREE process.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tThe SPREE process fostered conversations about the desire to incorporate evidence in decision-making and scaling.

Among others, the research questions include:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tHow do subgrantees develop local partnerships that allow the project to leverage community resources to connect candidates with supportive services and job opportunities?\r\n\tWhat challenges have the participating colleges encountered as they have implemented the BTW50+: WESI model?\r\n\tWhat are the key features of the BTW50+: WESI program model as intended by AARP Foundation, and to what extent have subgrantees achieved fidelity to this model, as measured through a standardized fidelity assessment checklist?\r\n\tTo what extent do subgrantees have the internal capacity and commitment to offer effective training services to the 50+ population after the conclusion of the program period?\r\n\tTo what extent do subgrantees target different subsets of job candidates, such as women who have experienced economic hardship as a result of limited work experience or long spells of unemployment, women with limited English language or literacy skills, or women over 60 years of age?\r\n\tWhat changes in attitudes and behavior (related to quality of life, financial management, and computer use) do job candidates exhibit during the year after enrollment?\r\n\r\n\r\nFindings:\r\n\r\nThe evaluation found the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tBTW50+: WESI was implemented as intended in terms of the number and types of job candidates enrolled, as well as the design, delivery, and receipt of program services.\r\n\tSubgrantees reported the following challenges:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tlimitations in the types of jobs available in the local labor market,\r\n\t\tdifficulty maintaining a stable staff given time-limited grant funding,\r\n\t\tdifficulty tracking job candidate outcomes during the follow up period, and\r\n\t\tlimited financial capacity to take over funding the program when the grant ended.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tEmployer engagement was the most challenging component of the model for subgrantees to implement.\r\n\tJob candidates who completed surveys and participated in focus groups gave high satisfaction ratings on core components of the BTW50+: WESI program. However, many job candidates felt that connections with employers needed to be stronger.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information, download the full report and report brief.\r\n",

The project is also designed to generate both practical knowledge about how AmeriCorps and other funders can successfully scale effective interventions. \r\n\r\nGoals:\r\nThe goal of this report is to examine the extent to which organizations describe the intervention and organizational factors that are important for being ready to scale an intervention with evidence of effectiveness.\r\n\r\nResearch Questions:\r\nThe research questions are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tHow do organizations demonstrate that their interventions are ready for scaling?\r\n\tHow do organizations demonstrate they are ready for scaling interventions?\r\n\tHow do organizations demonstrate overall readiness for scaling?\r\n\r\n\r\nFindings\r\nThis report found that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIntervention Readiness:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tWell-specified intervention: Fifty-six percent of organizations specified the intervention in their scaling plans with full or limited details. When describing the intervention, organizations most often lacked a description of the qualifications for those who will deliver the intervention (personnel needs) and a definition of intervention completion. \r\n\t\tWell-defined target population: All organizations described the target population for the intervention with full or limited details. \r\n\t\tImplementation supports: Forty-eight percent of organizations described all implementation supports with full or limited details. When organizations did not describe all supports, they most often lacked a description of continuous quality improvement (CQI) processes. \r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tOrganizational Readiness:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tEnabling context: Twelve percent of organizations specified all three components of enabling context in at least a limited way. Organizations were more likely to describe support from organization leadership, stakeholders, and partners and least likely to describe encountering past implementation challenges.\r\n\t\tImplementation infrastructure: Thirty-six percent of organizations provided in their scaling plans at least some description of financial resources, intervention materials, sufficient personnel, physical space, and human resource management systems. Organizations scaling plans most often lacked a description of intervention materials. Financial resources and personnel for the intervention were most frequently described.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tOverall Readiness for Scaling:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tOverall scaling readiness: Using the scaling readiness framework developed for this study, we found that 32 percent of organizations provided at least some description of all three intervention readiness conditions; 4 percent of organizations provided at least some description of both organizational readiness conditions; and no organization provided at least some description of all five conditions of scaling readiness.\r\n\t\tScaling readiness by AmeriCorps requirements: When examining scaling readiness based on an assessment of those elements of our framework that align with AmeriCorps reporting requirements, we found that demonstration of scaling readiness increases. With a revised definition of scaling readiness, we found that 40 percent of all organizations specify all three conditions of intervention readiness, 36 percent of all organizations specify both conditions of organizational readiness, and 24 percent of all organizations provide some description of all five conditions of scaling readiness.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information, download the report.\r\n\r\nScaling Evidence-Based Models (SEBM) Project\r\n\r\n The Office of Research and Evaluation (ORE) initiated the Scaling Evidence-Based Models project to support the scaling of effective interventions.

This information will also help inform the agencys interest in identifying the intervention components that are critical for an interventions effectiveness.\r\n\r\nGoals:\r\nThe goal of this report is to identify AmeriCorps-funded interventions with evidence of effectiveness. This project defines evidence of effectiveness as rigorous research that has shown favorable impacts on the majority of the targeted outcomes for people receiving the intervention services. \r\n\r\nResearch Questions:\r\nThe research questions are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tWhat interventions consistently demonstrate evidence of effectiveness for their targeted outcomes? \r\n\t\r\n\t\tWhich AmeriCorps-funded interventions demonstrate evidence of effectiveness on participants outcomes? \r\n\t\tAmong interventions with evidence of effectiveness, what are their characteristics? \r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tWhat intervention characteristics demonstrate evidence of effectiveness at a scale that suggests readiness for replication more widely? \r\n\t\r\n\t\tHow effective are AmeriCorps interventions with evidence of effectiveness? \r\n\t\tWhat characteristics of the interventions might be associated with the estimated impacts? \r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nFindings\r\nThis report found that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\t39 percent of interventions implemented by grantees given a strong or moderate evidence rating in a systematic evidence review by independent contractors and reviewers for AmeriCorps (other than Mathematica) met the evidence of effectiveness standards developed for this project. \r\n\tAmong the assessed criteria, the primary reasons that studies did not meet the Mathematica standards were:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tA lack of internal validity that gives confidence that the intervention, and not other factors, impacted intervention participants (46 percent)\r\n\t\tResults that were not consistently favorable (44 percent) \r\n\t\tA lack of a comparison group (40 percent)\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tThe 32 interventions that met the Mathematica standards fell primarily in the education focus area (56 percent), with 28 percent aligning with the economic opportunity focus area and 16 percent falling under the healthy futures focus area. These 32 interventions were predominately implemented in urban settings (97 percent), although 16 percent were implemented in rural areas. About half (47 percent) were implemented in more than one region of the country, and more than one-quarter (29 percent) had AmeriCorps members involved in delivering services or supporting the delivery.\r\n\tParticipants in the AmeriCorps-funded interventions meeting the Mathematica effectiveness standards had better outcomes than 61 percent of participants who did not receive the intervention. This represents an 11 percentage point increase in beneficial outcomes. The size of this impact varied by focus area. \r\n\tInterventions in the education and healthy futures focus areas increased beneficial outcomes for intervention participants by 9 percentage points, compared to those not receiving the intervention. \r\n\tFor interventions in the economic opportunity focus area, the impact reached 14 percentage points. The size of the impacts varied by AmeriCorps priority objective. \r\n\tInterventions aligning with the employability, K12 success, postsecondary education support, school readiness, and supportive family environments priority objectives had statistically significant positive impacts. \r\n\tImpacts did not vary by geographic region, or the use of AmeriCorps members, which suggests that interventions might be equally effective across communities and that AmeriCorps members are as effective as other types of personnel at delivering or supporting the delivery of services. \r\n\t\r\n\t\tImpacts also did not vary by intervention funding year, which suggests that AmeriCorps has year-to-year consistency in identifying interventions supported by rigorous evidence of effectiveness.\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information, download the report.\r\n\r\nScaling Evidence-Based Models (SEBM) Project\r\n\r\n The Office of Research and Evaluation (ORE) initiated the Scaling Evidence-Based Models project to support the scaling of effective interventions.

The outcomes take additional time to achieve, especially for participants who are spending a relatively longer amount of time in contextualized adult basic education and job training at the outset of program involvement.\r\n\tTo strengthen opportunities for participants to improve financial outcomes over time, LISC piloted a more intensive level of investment in and focus on post-placement coaching (also called retention coaching) in a subset of Bridges sites.  \r\n\tWhile ongoing engagement with coaches was always a component of the Bridges and FOC models, constraints on Bridges staff time often result in resources being concentrated with trainees and training graduates seeking their initial job.  \r\n\tRetention coaches provide long-term financial coaching and career advancement services. This allows LISC subgrantees a longer period to work with program participants on their job advancement goals and their overall financial healthparticularly as workers financial goals and needs change over time.\r\n\tLISC will continue to assess the efficacy of retention coaching in moving Bridges participants financial outcomes such as credit score and expand program enhancements like retention coaching as they scale and strengthen the Bridges work.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information, download the:\r\n\r\nFull Report\r\n\r\nReport Brief\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

TCHFH aims to increase access to affordable and safe housing for families with an income between 30% and 80% of the median income. \r\n \r\n\r\nStudy Goals:\r\nThe goal of the study was to make meaningful comparisons between families matched with a home by TCHFH and those who are not yet matched by the organization. The evaluation adopted a QED approach in which 49 families acquiring a home through TCHFH were matched with 49 similar families that qualified for TCHFH support but had not yet closed on a home. Through this comparison, TCHFH hopes to discover if houses built/renovated by TCHFH can have a positive impact on low-income families by lowering their person-per-bedroom ratio and raising their level of home satisfaction.\r\n \r\n\r\nResearch Questions:\r\nThe research questions were:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tTo what extent do families matched with a TCHFH home have a lower person-per-bedroom (PPB) rate relative to similar families who have not been matched with a home?\r\n\tTo what extent does the probability of meeting federal guidelines for PPB differ between families matched with a TCHFH home and those still awaiting a match?\r\n\tRelative to a matched comparison group, to what extent do families matched with a TCHFH home report higher feelings of overall home satisfaction as measured by general satisfaction, safety, and housing issues?\r\n\t \r\n\r\n\r\nFindings:\r\nThe evaluation found that: \r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe results provide consistent and strong evidence that TCHFH helps to decrease PPB ratios and increase housing satisfaction. \r\n\tA Logical Regression Model was completed showing the influence of the intervention (housing provided by TCHFH) that suggested that working with TCHFH correlated with: \r\n\t\r\n\t\tStatistically significant (p<.05) decreases in PPB ratios (decrease of 0.68) \r\n\t\tHigher home satisfaction \r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tThese effects are meaningful, in particular for PPB, which has been shown to be highly correlated with quality-of-life metrics. \r\n\tTCHFH home placement was associated with a 0.68 decrease in the PPB ratio and a 21% point21%-point increase in the probability of meeting the PPB ratio benchmark.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information, download: \r\nFull Report\r\n \r\n",

    "body": "In 2016, AmeriCorps commissioned Mathematica to conduct the Scaling Evidence-Based Models (SEBM) project to gain insights into which AmeriCorps State and National and Social Innovation Fund interventions were effective and potentially ready to scale. This project was designed to generate practical knowledge and insights on the commonalities of effective interventions, and how AmeriCorps might successfully scale effective interventions to benefit more people. \r\n\r\nResearchers on the SEBM project developed the Scaling Programs with Research Evidence and Effectiveness (SPREE) process detailed in the SPREE Report to help identify which funded interventions show effectiveness and demonstrate readiness to scale. This report focuses on the SPREE process and how review rubrics applied to AmeriCorps Program Evaluation Reports provide evidence that the SPREE process can be replicated by other funding agencies and grantmaking entities interested in identifying and supporting the scaling of interventions with evidence of effectiveness. This SPREE process was applied to interventions funded from 2015 to 2019 by the AmeriCorps State and National program, and interventions from 2010 to 2015 funded by the SIF.\r\n\r\nGoals:\r\nThe goal of the report is to identify the critical components of intervention effectiveness that grantees can scale to produce a wider impact through the SEBM assessment rubric.\r\n\r\nResearch Questions:\r\nThe research questions are a part of the criteria applied to each program evidence report  AmeriCorps grantees submit to determine eligibility for further review:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tProject objectives\r\n\t\r\n\t\tDid the study use a comparison group in its research design to allow for causal inferences about the intervention's impact?\r\n\t\tDid the study sufficiently describe its research design and statistical approach? \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tFor example, did the study provide adequate information on the formation of its study groups and the statistical procedures used to gauge the impacts of the intervention?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tWas the study conducted by an evaluator external to the grantee?\r\n\t\tDid the study show consistently favorable findings on the intervention's outcomes of interest? \r\n\t\tIs the intervention assessed in the study aligned to the intervention the grantee plans to scale up?\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tInternal validity\r\n\t\r\n\t\tIf the study was a randomized controlled trial (RCT), did the study experience high attrition?\r\n\t\tIf the study was an RCT, did the study use reassignment?\r\n\t\tFor an RCT study that had high attrition or used reassignment or a study that used a quasi-experimental design, did the study demonstrate baseline equivalence?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tDid it show that the intervention and comparison groups in the final analytic sample are similar on a pre-test outcome measure at baseline?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tDoes the study have the presence of a confounding factor that makes it difficult to distinguish between the effect of that factor and the intervention, thus making it impossible to attribute any potential impacts solely to the intervention?\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nFindings:\r\nThis report shares the reviewer developed a two-part rubric for systematically reviewing documents submitted by AmeriCorps organizations that (1) provided evidence of an intervention's effectiveness and (2) described plans for scaling the effective intervention. \r\n\r\n\r\n\tIntervention review section: Reviewers used this first part of the rubric to review the evaluation reports submitted to AmeriCorps by organizations as support for their interventions' effectiveness. In this section, reviewers described the intervention as implemented and evaluated. \r\n\tScaling readiness section: Reviewers used this second part of the rubric to review the scaling plans and application narratives submitted by AmeriCorps organizations. This part of the rubric was designed to understand organizations' planned activities for scaling the interventions with evidence of effectiveness. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information, download the Full Report\r\n\r\nScaling Evidence-Based Models (SEBM) Project\r\n\r\n The Office of Research and Evaluation (ORE) initiated the Scaling Evidence-Based Models project to support the scaling of effective interventions.

Below are additional scaling resources:\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nGuides:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tScaling an Intervention: Recommendations and Resources: The guide provides five key recommendations that will help funders like AmeriCorps, other government agencies, and philanthropic organizations identify which funded interventions are effective, enhance their knowledge base on scaling them, and pursue scaling.\r\n\tHow to Fully Describe an Intervention: This guide is intended to help practitioners to thoroughly describe their intervention and communicate the following to potential funders or stakeholders.\r\n\tBuild Organizational Capacity to Implement an Intervention: This guide will help practitioners prepare to implement their desired intervention through building organizational capacity, which involves establishing the organizational structure, workforce, resources, processes, and culture to enable success.\r\n\tHow to Structure Implementation Supports: This guide will help practitioners develop formal strategies (also known as implementation supports) to help consistently deliver an intervention as it was designed, which is especially helpful for organizations scaling an intervention and assessing implementation fidelity.\r\n\tMaking the Most of Data: This guide will help practitioners maximize the use of their intervention data to help their organizations improve program implementation and provide evidence to funders about effectiveness.\r\n\tWhat Makes for a Well-Designed, Well-Implemented Impact Study: This guide is intended to help practitioners ensure that their evaluators produce high-quality impact studies.\r\n\tBaseline Equivalence: What it is and Why it is Needed: This guide is designed to help practitioners and researchers work together to design an impact study with baseline equivalence and in turn learning how to determine if an impact study is likely to produce meaningful results.\r\n\tScaling Programs with Research Evidence and Effectiveness (SPREE): This article focuses on how the foundations can apply the SPREE process and provides insights into conditions that can help identify and support effective interventions that are ready to be scaled.\r\n\r\n\r\nTools:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tScaling Checklists: Assessing Your Level of Evidence and Readiness (SCALER): This report describes a framework that identifies how organizations can improve both their readiness to scale an intervention and the interventions readiness to be scaled, so that intervention services are best positioned to improve outcomes for a larger number of participants. Each checklist in the SCALER provides summary scores to reflect how ready an intervention and organization might be for scaling.\r\n\r\n\r\nReports:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tPlanned Scaling Activities of AmeriCorps-Funded Organizations: This report presents scaling readiness findings for a cohort of 25 organizations that provided plans to scale interventions with evidence of effectiveness and it examines variations in demonstrated scaling readiness across AmeriCorps funding years.\r\n\tEvidence of Effectiveness in AmeriCorps-Funded Organizations: This report is designed to help inform the agencys interest in identifying the intervention components that are critical for an interventions effectiveness.\r\n\r\n\r\nCase Studies:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tScaling the Birth and Beyond (B&B) Intervention: Insights from the Experiences of the Child Abuse Prevention Council (CAPC): This case study describes the scaling of Birth and Beyond (B&B), a parenting education and support intervention designed to reduce child maltreatment, by the Child Abuse Prevention Council of Sacramento (CAPC) and its partners.\r\n\tScaling the Reading Corps Intervention: Insights from the Experiences of the United Way of Iowa: This case study describes the scaling of Reading Corps, a literacy intervention designed to improve reading proficiency by United Ways of Iowa (UWI) and its partners.\r\n\tScaling the Home Instruction for Parents of Preschool Youngsters (HIPPY) Intervention: Insights from the Experiences of Parent Possible: This case study describes the scaling of Home Instruction for Parents of Preschool Youngsters (HIPPY), a home-visiting intervention that seeks to help parents improve their young childrens development, by Parent Possible and its partners.\r\n\r\n",

    "body": "The Volunteer Generation Fund (VGF) program was authorized by the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act in 2009 and invests in volunteer management practices that strengthen nonprofit organizations and other entities ability to increase recruitment and retention of volunteers to meet critical community needs through service. To learn more about VGF grants and best practices in volunteer recruitment and retention, the AmeriCorps Office of Research and Evaluation contracted a research firm to conduct an evaluation with a mixed-methods case study design. The evaluation assessed how 9 State Service Commissions that were recipients of the FY2020 VGF program implemented their grants to develop and/or support community-based entities to recruit, manage, and support volunteers within their states as well as the outcomes of VGF grantees efforts. The study also included delivering evaluation capacity building sessions to participating grantees. By simultaneously growing the evidence base on volunteer engagement and management practices and incorporating capacity building and dissemination activities, AmeriCorps was able to support organizations more effectively in enhancing the impact of volunteers on critical community needs. GoalsThe study examines:Program design, which will largely be descriptive and utilize qualitative methods (interviews and document review) to document the overall program designs for each selected state;Program implementation, using qualitative methods to assess how program implementers work with volunteer organizations, schools, and youth programs; andProgram outcome, utilizing both qualitative and quantitative methods to look at impacts of the programs on beneficiaries (i.e., volunteer organizations, schools, youth programs, and volunteers).Research QuestionsWhat are state commissions approaches for utilizing VGF funds to improve volunteer recruitment, retention, and support of volunteers within their states and among volunteer organizations?What are promising practices and challenges in implementing these approaches?What are preliminary outputs and outcomes of these approaches on volunteer organizations and volunteers?Materials and ResourcesFinal Evaluation ReportEvaluation OverviewEvaluation and Capacity Building Project Evidence SnapshotComprehensive Literature Review on Engaging VolunteersVolunteer Management and Engagement Resource GuideCase StudiesFloridaIowaMassachusettsMinnesotaNevadaNew HampshireNew JerseyNorth CarolinaUtah",

This community-based intervention was implemented in various areas in the city of Detroit. AMUSs goal was to build a network of deterrence meant to dissuade criminals from committing crimes, at every level, from the individual to the police precinct. \r\n\r\nStudy Goals:\r\nThe goal of the study was to assess the AMUS programs impact on key crime reduction outcomes. The study did this by describing how the crime reports in AMUS target areas (police precincts) changed over the course of the fiscal year, and the associated cost savings related to the level of crime reduction as well as the programs impact on annual crime rates.\r\n\r\nResearch Questions:\r\nThe research questions examined both the program and the economic impact. Those questions were:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tDid the trend in targeted crime rates significantly decrease in AMUS target areas compared to non-AMUS areas? \r\n\tOnce implemented, do AMUS target areas experience significantly lower crime rates than non-AMUS areas? \r\n\tWhat are the monetary costs associated with crime in AMUS target areas? \r\n\tGiven the reductions in crime, what is the total amount of imputed cost savings? \r\n\r\n\r\nFindings:\r\nThe research results examined crime patterns, the programs impact, and the economic impact. The study found the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAcross major crime categories, crime reports within precincts served by AMUS have declined. \r\n\tA consistent pattern emerged where the reduction in subsequent crime rates was more than twice that of the implementation year. \r\n\tWhen compared to the period immediately preceding AMUS implementation, crime reports were significantly reduced and sustained after the first program year. \r\n\tWith the amount of crime reported reduced in AMUS areas, an estimated $378 million was saved by alleviating crime-related activities. \r\n\r\n\r\nFor more information, download the:\r\n\r\nFull Report\r\n",

This report highlights responses to the closed-ended questions of the AmeriCorps NCCC Sponsor Organization Survey sent to AmeriCorps NCCC Traditional Corps who completed projects beginning in June 2016 and through September 2019 (941 total sponsors across all five regions). The report is organized around seven topic areas, plus a miscellaneous section. It also includes recommendations for NCCC sponsor feedback and revising sponsor surveys, and a discussion around how to interpret the findings and sample representation from each region.\r\n\r\nKey Findings by Topic Area Include:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tOverall: The majority of AmeriCorps NCCC sponsors were very positive about the NCCC program and teams across North Central, Pacific, Southern, and Southwest regions, while Atlantic region sponsors reported slightly less positive experiences in some cases.\r\n\tCommunity Need and Impact: The majority of sponsors (80% to 92% in each region) reported that AmeriCorps NCCC teams, either to a large extent or completely, met the primary community need (as identified by the sponsor) through their service and contributed to the achievement of the projects primary objectives.\r\n\tProject Quality and Engagement: The majority of sponsors (80% to 90% in each region) reported the overall quality of work performed on the projects by the AmeriCorps NCCC teams was exceptional or high, and about two-thirds of sponsors reported that the overall quality of work performed by AmeriCorps NCCC teams was somewhat to significantly better than other team-based support that their organizations received.\r\n\tTeam Training: Most sponsors (90% to 95% in each region) reported that, to a moderate and large extent, AmeriCorps NCCC teams came trained as a cohesive and functioning team. Teams also received additional training by sponsor organizations across all five regions.\r\n\tTeam Member Skills and Abilities: About three-quarters of sponsors reported a moderate to large positive change in a variety of NCCC teams professional skills.\r\n\tTeam Attitude, Responsibility, and Inclusion: Across all five regions, responses to questions asking about teams attitudes towards their projects work, timeliness, preparation, flexibility, adaptability, inclusivity of the communities they served, inclusivity within the sponsoring organization, and safety conscientiousness ranged from about 73% positive to 99% positive, with the majority in the range of 88% to 99%.\r\n\tBenefits to Your Organization: Nearly all of the sponsors (92% to 97% in each region) agreed or strongly agreed that AmeriCorps NCCC teams supported the mission of their organizations, and many reported that teams increased the number, speed, or quality of services provided, the number of individuals served, or community awareness of the organization.\r\n\tInvolvement and Satisfaction: Nearly all sponsors (92% to 96%) across North Central, Pacific, Southern and Southwest were satisfied to very satisfied with AmeriCorps NCCC teams, and the majority of sponsors (83% to 91% in each region) indicated their interest to sponsor another AmeriCorps NCCC team in the future.\r\n\tMiscellaneous: Sponsors considered the greatest strengths of AmeriCorps NCCC to be flexibility and adaptability, team work ethic or dedication, and level of team engagement, and considered the greatest areas for improvement to be travel logistics, lodging or housing logistics, and other.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmeriCorps NCCC Sponsor Survey Factsheet\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nRegional Survey Findings\r\n\r\nAmeriCorps NCCC North Central Region Survey Findings\r\n\r\nAmeriCorps NCCC Pacific Region Survey Findings\r\n\r\nAmeriCorps NCCC Southern Region Survey Findings\r\n\r\nAMERICORps NCCC Southwest Region Survey Findings\r\n",

The pilot project studied for this evaluation included tutoring and web-based math learning platforms provided to middle school students during their scheduled school day, five days a week in 45-minute sessions.\r\n\r\nStudy Goals\r\n\r\nThe goal of this study was to measure the effects of Blueprints hybrid tutoring program on math knowledge, student-tutor relationships, and student sense of belonging and confidence in math for middle school students in two schools. A secondary goal was to compare outcomes across students ending the year in small, medium, or large homebase tutoring groups.\r\n\r\nResearch Questions\r\n\r\nThe research questions were:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tAmong students identified to receive the tutoring program, what is the average attendance rate? Does attendance vary by homebase tutoring group size? \r\n\tDo students who participate in the tutoring program report having a high-quality relationship with their tutors? Does the reported quality of students relationships vary by homebase tutor group sizes? \r\n\tDo students who receive the tutoring program score higher on district assessments than students who do not receive the tutoring program? Does this difference vary by student characteristics? \r\n\tDo standardized math assessment scores vary by homebase tutor group sizes? \r\n\tDo students who receive the tutoring program report higher levels of math confidence and sense of belonging after receiving tutoring than before? Does this vary by homebase tutor group sizes? \r\n\r\n\r\nFindings\r\n\r\nThe evaluation found that:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tStudent attendance in tutoring sessions averaged 81.5 percent during the school year. \r\n\tMost students (76.8 percent) reported strong relationships with their tutors. A smaller share of students ending the year in large homebase groups (70.3 percent) reported strong relationships with their tutors, compared to students ending in small or medium-sized groups (77.3 and 83.9 percent).\r\n\tBlueprint participants had end-of-year Star Math assessment scores that were 0.12 standard deviations higher than their nonparticipant peers, after controlling for differences in baseline scores and characteristics. Based on this estimate, there is a 99 percent probability that the program improved student scores on the Star Math assessment. Descriptively, students in large homebase groups showed greater improvement in Star Math scores than those in either medium or small groups.\r\n\tStudent confidence in math and sense of belonging in tutoring increased modestly during the school year.\r\n\r\n\r\nFULL REPORT\r\n",

The research questions addressed in this report speak to each of the four domains:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tParticipants are the individual AmeriCorps members and volunteers who join AmeriCorps to serve local communities through AmeriCorps programs.\r\n\tPartners are the AmeriCorps grantees and sponsoring organizations that receive AmeriCorps program funding to implement service projects in their local communities using AmeriCorps members and volunteers.\r\n\tCommunities are the individuals, groups, and local areas that experience or receive services from AmeriCorps-funded grantees or sponsors delivered by AmeriCorps members and volunteers.\r\n\tSociety represents national service, volunteering, and civic engagement in the United States more broadly.\r\n\r\n\r\nResearch Questions\r\n\r\n\r\n\tWhat does AmeriCorps know about AmeriCorps participants?\r\n\t\r\n\t\tWhat are the characteristics of participants who serve with AmeriCorps?\r\n\t\tWhat outcomes and impacts, if any, do AmeriCorps participants experience?\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tWhat does AmeriCorps know about AmeriCorps partners?\r\n\t\r\n\t\tIn what ways, if any, has AmeriCorps helped build the capacity of grantees and sponsor organizations to achieve their missions and better serve their communities?\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tWhat does AmeriCorps know about communities served by AmeriCorps-funded grantees or sponsors and their members and volunteers?\r\n\t\r\n\t\tWhat outcomes or impacts, if any, do communities served by AmeriCorps-funded grantees or sponsors and their members and volunteers experience? \r\n\t\tWhat does the research say about investment in and scaling of effective interventions?\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tWhat does AmeriCorps know about national service, volunteering, and civic engagement in society?\r\n\t\r\n\t\tWhat are the societal rates of volunteerism, participation in national service, and civic engagement? How do these rates vary by demographic characteristics?\r\n\t\tWhat new insights has AmeriCorps-funded research generated to advance the fields understanding of national service, volunteering, and civic engagement?\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nKey Findings\r\n\r\n\r\n\tParticipants: Sixteen studies (14 percent of 116 studies) examined AmeriCorps participants characteristics and the benefits participants experience through serving or volunteering with AmeriCorps. \r\n\tPartners: Ten studies (9 percent of 116 studies) examined whether AmeriCorps helped build the capacity of partnersgrantees and sponsor organizationsto achieve their missions and better serve their communities. \r\n\tCommunities: Seventy-one studies (61 percent of 116 studies) examined how communities and the individuals within them benefit from AmeriCorps-funded interventions, the value generated from investing in AmeriCorps-funded interventions, or how to scale interventions to increase the scope of their impact. \r\n\tSociety: Twenty-five studies (22 percent of 116 studies) furthered evidence on national service, volunteering, and civic engagement in the United States. \r\n\r\n\r\nFULL REPORT: 2023 State of the Evidence Report\r\n\r\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\r\n\r\nSTATE OF THE EVIDENCE FRAMEWORK\r\n",

    "body": "The AmeriCorps Urban Safety Program (AMUS) aims to improve public health and safety in Detroit and Wayne County, Michigan. AmeriCorps members work to increase public safety by: 1) partnering with the local police to facilitate a crime mapping and analysis (CompStat) program to identify crime hot spots; 2) organizing neighborhood community patrols; 3) providing support to survivors of intimate partner violence; 4) implementing safe routes to neighborhood schools for youth; 5) securing vacant and open structures; and, 6) providing resources to help reduce property crime, such as home safety assessments and anti-theft auto devices. Recently, AMUS members have expanded their efforts to include public health activities, such as installing water filtration resources and sharing information with residents to increase the use of filtered water to reduce lead exposure, and distributing air purifiers filters to help residents improve home indoor air quality. To better understand the impact of the program in relation to costs, AmeriCorps commissioned a return on investment (ROI) analysis.\r\n\r\nKey Findings\r\n\r\n\r\n\tBenefits of AMUS include:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tReduced costs and increased economic benefits to society from reduced criminal activity in neighborhoods served by AMUS.\r\n\t\tReduced lifetime spending on the criminal justice system due to AMUS's summer employment program. \r\n\t\tAdditional societal benefits from increased employment by participants in AMUS's summer employment program. \r\n\t\tAdditional lifetime earnings resulting from decreased lead exposure. \r\n\t\tAdditional earnings by AmeriCorps members. \r\n\t\tLiving allowances, stipends, and education awards. \r\n\t\tAdditional lifetime earnings for youth members.\r\n\t\tIncreased tax revenue for government. \r\n\t\tReduced lifetime spending on corrections, public assistance, and social insurance. \r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n\tThe program produces strong returns in the short-, medium-, and long-term for total benefits per federal dollar and total benefits per funder dollar. The federal government benefits per federal dollar calculations estimate losses for the short- and medium-term scenarios and modest returns in the long-term scenario.

In 2017, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) declared a public health emergency in response to the increasing number of opioid-related overdoses and deaths. Due to differences in funding, policies, regulations, available resources, and the overall approach to addressing substance use disorders (SUDs), substance use treatment and harm reduction options may vary across states.One promising strategy to address the rising rates of SUDs and drug overdose is peer recovery coaching. As a type of peer support, a nonclinical professional with lived SUD experience provides guidance to individuals with a SUD by helping them access care, develop a personalized plan to promote long-term. recovery, and remove barriers to recovery (for example, housing, employment, or transportation).This study used a mixed methods approach to examine implementation and outcomes of peer recovery coaching models across four different AmeriCorps grantees.Research ObjectivesDescribe peer recovery coaching model approaches, including promising practices and implementation challenges.Understand how peer recovery coaching improves outcomes for organizations, peer recovery coaches, and program participants.FindingsLived experience is crucial to peer recovery coaching because it facilitates relationship-building between coaches and participants.Peer recovery coaches support participants in recovery from SUDs and mental health diagnoses.Grantees reported capacity improvements in providing services, leveraging financial support, and collaborating with partners.Peer recovery coaches reported increased knowledge, improved attitudes and behaviors, as well as increased opportunities for maintaining their own recovery.Program participants reported high levels of recovery capital (internal and external resources that enhance capacity for and commitment to living a sober life), which were greater than their counterparts who did not receive peer recovery coaching.APHA PosterEVALUATION OVERVIEWCOHORT 1 SNAPSHOT",

Peer recovery coaching, which involves nonclinical professionals with lived experience of substance use disorders (SUDs) guiding others in recovery, is a promising strategy to combat this issue. A study examining peer recovery coaching models across four AmeriCorps grantees found that lived experience is essential for building relationships, and that such coaching improves recovery outcomes for participants, enhances service capacity for organizations, and benefits peer coaches' knowledge and recovery. Participants showed significant recovery capital compared to those without peer support."

FEMA Corps works solely on emergency management and long-term recovery activities within FEMA, helping coordinate services for disaster survivors. FEMA Corps projects may involve indirect assignments in the FEMA offices that support FEMAs overall mission or direct assignments in disaster sites, such as helping survivors in remote regions sign up for Disaster Survivor Assistance.Summer of Service is a simplified version of NCCC's other programs, on a shortened timeframe. As with all other NCCC programs, members will participate in pre-service training, albeit a shorter version, and serve on teams. Forest Corps is a program partnership between AmeriCorps NCCC and United States Forest Service. Members perform direct, hands-on service in the areas of wildfire risk mitigation, reforestation, environmental conservation, and resource management.  *AmeriCorps NCCC is a program for 18-24 by statute. During this study 25- and 26-year-olds were permitted by the CARES Act to participate. Leadership Skills (Longitudinal Study) ReportAmeriCorps NCCCs theory of change sets forth the core outcomes of leadership through service: 1) gain professional skills; 2) develop life skills; 3) teamwork; and 4) engagement in civic life. This report discusses the findings on whether and how service impacts members leadership skills through two objectives:Estimate the impact of service on members leadership skills.Examine the association between service project assignments and members' leadership skills.LEADERSHIP SKILLS REPORTLEADERSHIP SKILLS BRIEFLEADERSHIP SKILLS INFOGRAPHICMember Retention ReportRetaining members through their year of service is an important in order to achieve AmeriCorps desired impact on those who serve, the beneficiaries and the communities. Retaining  members maximizes the programs cost effectiveness and enhances sustainability. This report discusses the findings on factors that affect the retention of members through four objectives: Describe the characteristics of members who do not complete their term of service (early exit members).Describe motivation for service and reasons for leaving service.  Identify factors that contribute to member retention through the end of the service term.Discuss the lessons learned and best practices that can inform how best to maximize member retention. MEMBER RETENTION REPORTMEMBER RETENTION BRIEFStrengthening Communities ReportAmeriCorps promotes community building through service and demonstrates the capacity of government and nonprofit partnerships to improve communities and serve the most vulnerable. This report discusses the evidence of how AmeriCorps NCCC strengthens the communities in which its members serve through three objectives:Define what strengthening communities means in the context of AmeriCorps NCCC.  Assess the evidence of how AmeriCorps NCCC strengthens communities where its members serve.Calculate the social return on investment of AmeriCorps response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
